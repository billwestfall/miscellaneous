# Feldmanizer
=============
Ever wish you could have a never-ending autogenerated stream of music resembling Morton Feldman's quiet piano work?  No?  Well I did.
This is the Feldmanizer, in which I attempt to create such music.

## Requirements
Linux or Mac system (or Windows with full Cygwin installed)

Ruby

Alda

## Installation
1. You will first need to install and configure Alda : https://github.com/alda-lang/alda

   *NOTE:* for best results please follow the Alda directions to install the FluidR3 soundfont
   
2. Git clone this repository.  For pre-alpha purposes (aka a hack) please place the files from this repo in the same directory as your Alda install above

3. Open a terminal and cd to your Alda directory. Run the following command to make the shell script executable:
   `chmod +x feldmanizer.sh`
   
4. Finally run the following from terminal:
 

   `./feldmanizer.sh`
   
5. To exit the feldmanizer type CTL-C in the terminal window
