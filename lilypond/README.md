# froggerizer
=============
Much like the feldmanizer ( https://github.com/billwestfall/miscellaneous/tree/master/feldmanizer ) I wanted to create a randomizer for printed music.

Since Lilypond ( http://www.lilypond.org/ ) uses a text input like Alda, it should be able to create a randomizer for it.

## Requirements

Ruby

Lilypod ( http://www.lilypond.org/ )

## Instructions

1. Install Lilypond on your machine
2. Git clone this repo
3. Run the following command from the repo directory

   `ruby froggerizer.rb`
4. Copy the output into a file and save with an ".ly" extension
5. Open the file in Lilypond and run Compile - Typeset file.  Enjoy your music!
