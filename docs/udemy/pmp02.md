future value = present value times interest rate plus one to the power of the number of time periods 

- future value - project must be worth more than FV

present value = future value divided by one + interest rate to the power of time periods

if project costs more than PV might not be worth doing

- net present value

considers a project with multiple returns

NPV > zero is good

internal rate of return

PV = cash inflow
IRR higher is good
IRR low might be poor
