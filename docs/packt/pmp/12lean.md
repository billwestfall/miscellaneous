This is the beginning of a new section on Agile topics.We begin this section on Agile by first talking aboutwhat is definable work versushigh uncertainty work.Think about how we built the pyramids earlier in this course.This is an example of definable workwhere the method to build the structurewas predeterminedand well known.You start off withinitiating the project with a defined architectural designand various structural requirementsthat are needed to build the pyramid,the type of stone and the quality of stone that will be used to build. The pyramidis also knownwhere you would source the stone fromand the raw materials to create a motorused in the structureare well known.The expertise and the resources neededto build. The structureare also well known and definedwhat is also known as how to use those resourcesto start building the structure block by block in a sequential manner.By the time the project has begun,the experts on the project are not debating aboutthe foundational architectural designor structural requirements or what stone to be used for the pyramid.Those fundamental aspectsare well defined right at the beginningand don't usually change during the course of the project.There may be a complex interdependent set of tasksin building the pyramidor for that matter, any other structure.But the precise plan for those sequence of stepsare predetermined and well plannedand are contained within the project plan.These type of projects use a traditional predictive approachthat you were introduced so farwhere the work happens in defined sequence of stepsstarting with initiating, then going to the planning phase,then executingmonitoring and controllingand finally the closing phasein here,the planning happens all up frontfor all the work to be done on the project.The scope of work is well definedin the beginning of the projectupon which the planning happensall up frontfor all the work to be done on the project. Atthis pointon the pyramids project,the pharaoh is not going to change hismind overnight from going with a pyramidal structureto let's say a cylindrical structure.It is for this scope that all the planning has taken placein terms of the resources needed,how much time they will need to build the structurewhen and where the handoffs happen from one team to another.Where does the workof one team endand the work for the other team begins.For example,where does the work for the laborers who transport the stone endand the work of stone cutters beginis pretty well laid out in the project planning.During the execution of the project, the team focusesonly on doing the work to build a structurebased on the defined plan.This type of work is called definable work.Some of the examples include projectsthat are to build homes,malls,airports, bridgesand even drug development projects.Let's now talk about what is high uncertainty work.Think about building a software application for ordering food fromyour homes using drones like our Motor and Pestel app.This type of work is high uncertainty work.As you see the team that builds a complex system like this consists ofthe various engineers, architects,people from quality developers, testers,drone engineersand various other domain expertson a project like this. Think about where does the work of a software developer end?And the work of a drone engineer beginswhere how and when should someone with domain knowledge of aerodynamics,collaborate with developers?How should designers on the teamcollaborateto design simple user interfaceand build it right into the app for a delightful user experience.The successful delivery of this type of a project is based on peoplewith multiple perspectives and expertisecollaborating in a waythat ultimately delivers a working productdelivered in the fastest possible ways into the market.The high uncertaintyon these type of projectscomes from the fact that the teamsare constantly in a state of experimentation becausethe requirements that define the scope of the projectare not fully defined. In the beginning.For example,in the beginningto create a motor and pistol app using drones, the teams will only knowthey have a requirementto allow a user to order foodfrom a nearby home, selling food.But it is not clearhow far should the app look fora home that is selling food from the person ordering food?All of that will be clarifiedwell into the project.The teams are constantly testing which features will most delight the usersor sponsors or customersand how they can improve and deliver a better performing product or service.This type of work is high uncertainty workand needs a little different type of approachto manage the project itself.This is where agile approachorin other words, the adaptive approach comes into playwhat we will discuss next will introduce youto the topic of agile in it. You will learnthe various agile concepts,the agile mindset,what constitutes an agile themeand the various life cycles within the agile project management.

Let's begin talking about agile by first knowingthe origins of agile.Much of the concepts of A Gare rooted in the concepts oflean production and manufacturing.Pioneered in the late 20th centuryby the famousToyota car company.The concept of leanis based onworking relentlessly to cut down onany waste in the production or manufacturing process.At the core of every lean systemis a relentless effort to reduce response times from the time an order is receivedfrom the customerto the final delivery of the product to the customer.As you will seevarious great concepts used in the lean systemswere then carried over to be usedin the software development and technology related projectsto obtain the same core benefitthat iscutting down timesfrom the time of the birth of a conceptto the delivery of the final working product.This need to better manage technology projectsthat are inherently riskyand of high uncertaintyhas given rise to a new approach of project management.This new approach is called the adaptive approach to project management.And the mindset behind this adaptive approachis the agile approach that we will discuss shortlyin order to better understand the concepts of lean,I now introduce to youa simple example called as the Mortar and Pestle Chocolate Factory.Let's sayour famous mortar and Pestle company also has a chocolate candy making divisioncalled the Mortar and Pestle Chocolate Factory.For the sake of simplicity,let's say they are in the business of making only one type of chocolate candy bars,their most famousroasted almond chocolate candy barsmade out of basic ingredients likemilk, cocoaand roasted almonds.Now you and I know chocolate making isa complex process and involves a lot more ingredientsthan these three simple ingredientsmentioned here. Our intention here is not to learnhow exactly to make chocolate candy,but to learn the concepts of lean production and manufacturingthrough this example.Hence, I have attemptedto teach and explain this through a simple and rather comical exampleof a fictitious chocolate factory.This will help us understandthe core concepts oflean production and manufacturingthat will then help us understandthe foundational concepts of agile used in software development projects.Let's also assume that their product,the almond roasted chocolate candy barsare so unique in taste and so much liked by the publicthat there is a huge demand for their chocolate.I'm putting this assumption out to eliminate the discussion aroundmarket economicsand the supply demand optimizations, etc.We will simply assume thatthere is a huge demand for their chocolateand all the chocolate they produce is immediately sold to the customerand that it generates immediate cash for the company.Thus,the only thing that the factory has on its mindis how fast can they make their chocolate to meet the demand?Orders are received from their customerswho are usuallybig wholesalersand they order in huge quantities from this factory,let's say100,000 units at a timeto be distributed and sent across the countryto be sold in various retail stores.With that introduction of this mortar and pestle chocolate factory.Let's get into the details ofunderstanding what happens inside this chocolate factory.

This is the chocolate production processinside the Motor and Pestel Chocolate factory.Once an order is received from a customer,let's say a large wholesale supplier,this is what happens next.Inside the chocolate factory,we now enter inside the factory to see the chocolate making operations.The process starts off simultaneouslyat two different workstations. Aworkstation is a place in the factory where individual operations are done.It could be a machine, a bench,an assembly table or simply a mixing area.As in this case,various ingredients are mixed togetheratthis workstation.It could be operated automaticallysay by a robot or by a human being.The first workstationis the workstation for churning. This is wherethe milk and cocoa are mixed to the right proportion.The second workstation is where the roasting of almonds takes place.As you can see, there are many more workstations later down the linein the chocolate making process.Once the milk and cocoa are churned togetherin the right proportion,they are sent to the next workstation,which is where further mixing happenswith the roasted almonds that are coming from the previous workstation atthis workstation the three ingredients are fully mixed in the right proportionbased on certain specificationsto producegreat tasting chocolate.This mixture is then sent to the molding workstationwhich is where the semi liquid is poured into moldsof square shapesthat you see in the end product.These are then cut into rectangular shaped chocolate candy bars.Those candy bars are then cool down to the room temperatureand finally sent to the packaging workstation.The last workstation createspiles of finished productthat are then loaded into huge trucksand shipped across the country.This is the entire process of creating roasted almond chocolate candy barsatthe Motor and Pestel Chocolate Factory.We will be using this exampleto understandmuch of the concepts of leanand how those concepts extendto the agile approach

If we were to roll up the tasks at a higher level,this is what it would look like from start to end atthe mortar and Pestle Chocolate Factory.First, the company receives an order from the customerto make chocolate candy bars.After the receipt of the order from the customer,the raw materials are ordered from the inventory within the factoryor from its outside suppliers.The next step is to begin the systematicand control process of mixing the right ingredients,pouring in the molds, cooling them,perform some tests and do quality checksand finally package the candy bars for final delivery.The final step is to deliver the product to the customer andreceive cash from the customer for the sale of the product.This set of specific actions performed by the factoryfrom the time of receiving the orderto moving through the various stages of productionand finally to deliver the finished product to the customeris called the value stream.A value stream is a sequence of activities an organization takesto deliver upon a customer's request.These individual steps form a chain of stepsin what is also called a value chain.The flow of value starts when the factory receives the order from the customerand that value flowsthrough all the steps in the middle, which is wherethe product is actually builtor produced.Finally,it ends with some form of monetary benefit that is deliveredto the company through the receipt of cash from the customer.

The total time to deliver the final product to the customer.From the time the order was received is called the lead timeor the response timecycle time is the time spent by the factory to create the product.The cycle time is always less than the lead time.Let's say the total time that the Motor and Pestel Chocolate factory takesto deliver the 100,000 chocolate barsthat were ordered by the customeris one weekfrom the time the customer placed the order.Thus the total time from order to cashis the total lead time, which is one weekall the time that the factory takes to process the raw materials, mix it together,pour them in molds and packageis a total cycle time.Let's say this is five daysfor the customer who placed the order.It is the seven days lead timethat matters the mostthe cycle time.That is how much time does a factory take to process,to process the raw materials and build the finalproduct is of no concern to the customer.All they care aboutis the total lead time,which is the timethe factory takesto deliver the final product to them afterthey have taken the order from the customerfor the people working on the factory. It is a cycle time. That is of most concern.Let me explain this through another example.When you go to a restaurant for dinnerand placed an order for food,the lead time is the time betweenafter you have placed the order with the waiterto the timewhen the waiter actually deliversthe food on your table.That is the lead timeand that is a time that matters to you as a customer,the cycle time is a timewhen the actual work begins when the chef starts to prepare your foodto the point in time when it is delivered to you on your table,which as you can see is always lesser than the lead time.

Let's now see how we can relate this world of lean production and manufacturingto the world of software development.The value stream in the technology world is very similarto the value stream. We just discussedwith some differences.This is how the value stream looks like for a typical software development project.It starts withwhen a customer or a sponsor expresses a need to have a software applicationbuilt with specific business need.At this point, it is only a concept in the minds of stakeholders or sponsorswho see a business reasonto initiate a projectthat then converts this conceptinto a monetary benefitwhich manifests in the form of a software applicationthat is then used by customersthat then generates cash for the companyin the Motor and Pistol app. Example,the company has an idea to build an app that enables peopleto order homemade food from homes around them.They figured that current food delivery appsdon't fulfill this need becausethey all deliver food only from restaurants.Based on their research. They have seen that people would want to try other options,especially healthy optionsand that has generated a business need to create an appwhich can order food from homes.Hence, they see this immense opportunity to generate cash from this idea.If they can quickly build an app that caters to this market.The value stream of a typical software project looks like thisjust like a value stream in a factory has multiple series of steps.Each step denoting a processinghappening at a particular workstationto produce an intermediate product.A tech value stream also has multiple steps in its value chain.Just like as if you're converting the raw materials to cashin a production value stream,you're converting a concept into cashin a technology value stream.However, unlike how a value stream in a factory begins with taking inthe inventory of raw materials from outside of the factory. Forfurther processing,the tech value stream begins with taking in the business idea or concept.It is from this concept and understanding of the customer's needs are obtained.This understanding is then formulated asthe customer requirementsthat function as the inventory of raw materials.These requirements will then be used tobuild the actual software product downstream.More on this topic. Later,when we discuss how these requirements are shaped in the form of user stories,the team then gets to work to build a software product,they test their codejust like in a factory workstationand finally deploy and delivera working product to the customernote. The final delivery only includes the working product,a product that the customer can start usingimmediately for whatever business need they had.Since this is a working product that the customer can start using immediately.The customer is willing to pay cash at this pointwhen this product is delivered.And hence, this is something of value to the customer.As you will see later,this working product need not be the final product asked by the customerbut can be an intermediate incrementthat finally becomesa complete working solution as the customer imagined.

We will now understand another important concept in the value stream context.It's called the throughput.To understand this.Let's see how the flow of value happens inside the factory.All the money that the company has invested inthe purchase of raw materials is called inventory.In our case, this is the money spent on purchasing the millions of gallons of milkand the tons of cocoa and almonds.In addition to the other raw materials that may have been usedin the production of the chocolate.This is the inventory that the company intends to convertmost of it. If not all of itinto the final product,that is the chocolate candy bars.They know not all of the inventory can be converted to chocolate. Some of itis gonna go waste due to various reasonsduring the production process.Once the raw materials are set in motion through the workstations for processingthat money is now tied up in the form of intermediate unfinished products,money in the form of labor,cost of machinery,buildings, tools and so on.So the operating expenseis all the money that the company spendsin order to convert the inventoryinto a finished product that it can eventually sell.Finally, once the product is ready in its final packaged form, atthe end of the factory assembly line,that money is in the form ofthe finished product ready to be sold.The rate at which the company generates money throughthe sale of this final product is called throughput.Note this definition of throughput is notthe rate at which the company generates moneythrough the production of the final product.But it is ratherthe sale of the final product.The company can decide to produce as much as it wants, maybe more than it can sell.But if there are no buyers or customers for the market for the product,all that production is gonna go waste.That is the reason whythe definition of throughput is the rate at which thecompany generates money through the sale of the final productand not the production of the final product.Hence, throughput is the measure of how fast can the company generate moneythrough the delivery of value to the customer.The sooner we deliver a product,the sooner the customer will pay us for itin the software value stream.The throughput is the rate at which the software development teamis able to deliver a working product to the customer.A working product meansa productthat has been builtbased on a solid design,a robust codeand fully tested that generates valueto the end usernote, just like in the above definitionin the factory value streamhere too,it is not defined as the rate at which the software development team isable to deliver features that the customer won't use ever.Hence the definition of throughput here is therate at which the software development team isable to deliver a working product to the customer.

As we saw in the technology value stream.The first block hereis to understand the customer's requirements.Requirements represent something that the softwareyou're trying to build must doto fulfill the business need.These are the functionalities of the product you're trying to buildexample in the Motor and Pestle app, the requirement of the systemis to be able to show nearby homes cooking food near youshow what cuisines they're offering as homemade food.And the app should show the prices of the foodof individual food items,delivery methods.And if it's drone based show in real time, the position of the droneand the estimated time of arrival, etc,some of the requirements that may be hidden arethe system should securely store our private customer data like names, addresses,phone numbers, etc.This list of inventory requirementsbecome hugeas a list of features and capabilities grow in the app that you're trying to build.Drawing parallels from the factory value stream.These list of requirements appear to be just like the inventory of raw materialsthat we use to build the final product in the factory.In fact, the visual symbol used in the tech value streamto show the list of requirementsthat are used to build. The software are shown as a Stack of inventory itemsjust like this.And it is used even till todayin the world of agile.It is this inventory of requirements that flowthrough the value stream in the form of codewritten by software developersand that code gets tested, verified and finally assembledor released. In other words,to create the final working product.For example, the above set of requirementswhen built coded tested and released, create the Motor and Pestel app,the term requirements have been used predominantly in projectsthat had definable work work that waspredictive in how you would translate those requirementsinto working code. As shown belowas you will see soon for projects that are high uncertainty work.This approach to managing requirements is just not enoughand that is where there are better ways to managing requirements come into play.These, we will learn lateron the topic of user stories.

We are now going to be learninganother important topic in the area of lean and by extension, the world ofagile.This is the topic on Kanban.The wordKanban is a Japanese wordand it means a signalor a visual sign or simply a cardused originally on the factory floor to show visually something has moved,especially the movement of inventory.This is how a realcarbon card looks like on the factory floorused in the production process.And it contains a lot of information aboutwhat product has been movedand in what quantityand to which workstationlet's use our motor and pestel chocolate factory example to understand in depth,what isKanbanas you saw earlier,the first step in the production of chocolateis to churn the mixture of milk and cocoato the right consistencyat the churning workstation.This is the training station that takes inthe stock of raw materials that is used inside the workstation for processingon this site is the warehouse of all the inventory where all theraw materials are stored and supplied to the workstations on the factory floorin the productionof the chocolate candy bars.Let's say this workstation can process 10 jars of milkand 10 bags of cocoa to start the churning process atmaximum capacity.This is all the inventory that is waiting to be moved into the churning workstation.Every inventory on the factory floor has a cardthat shows the exact quantity of that stock,the product informationand other identifying information about that inventory.You see this small yellow card here on the inventory that is stocked up here.This card shows that there is currently 10 jars ofmilk waiting to be moved into the next working stationas the 10 jars of milk and 10 bags ofcocoa are moved from the inventory to the churning workstation.Something unique happens.The raw materials move to the rightas showninto the next workstation.But take a look at what happens to the yellow card. What is important to notethat the small yellow card doesn't move along the inventoryinto the workstation but rather goes in the opposite direction.This card moves to the previous workstationand in this case, since the previous workstation wasthe inventory warehouse.The card moves into the inventory warehouse.The receipt of this card at the warehouseindicates that the stock has been moved to the next workstationinforming the warehouseto replenish for the stock that has been moved.Since the cards show exactly how much inventory is moved.The warehouse knows exactly how much to send forward to replenish.This same process happens at every workstation downstream.For example,when the mixing workstation is ready to startmixing the churn mixture of milk and cocoaand mix it with the roasted almonds that are ready.The inventory of intermediate product is moved on to the mixing workstation.As this happens, cards are sent back to the churning workstationand the roasting workstationsimultaneously.These cards indicatethese two workstations to get to workand start preparing the mixture of milk and cocoain the churning workstation and start roastingthe almonds in the roaster workstation.This practical system that is usedto communicate between the various workstationson the factory production lineis called the Kanbansystem.This is a highly visual system of communication basedon the cards that move along the value streamand are used to decideon one simple matterthat is to produce or not to produce at each workstation. Itis essentially a pull based demand driven systemwhere the downstream workstation decidesif they are ready to pull in work from the upstream workstations.No workstation on its own can decide if they want to keep producingwithout receiving a card from the downstream workstation.This prevents piling up of unnecessary stock before a workstation.As you can see, this is not a forecast driven systemwhere you can predict how much of stock is needed downstream,but rather a pull based systemwhere the downstream workstations decide how muchto pull inventory from the previous workstations.No workstation can preempt to start to produce on their own without a carboncard sent to them from the downstream workstation.As you'll see later, this system will also controlhow to minimize wasteand unnecessary production that may happen.

This is our full chocolate production process atthe mortar and pestle chocolate factory.As you can see,there are a lot of things happening whenthe process to make chocolate candy kicks offall the activity on the factory floor can be shown on what is called as the Kanbanboard.Here is how it looks like.The first is all the inventory waiting tobe called into the workstations for processing.Since these are the raw materials waiting to be processed,this is putin the to do column as shown here, then is all the processing of raw materialsthat happens at the individual workstationsthat are from hereto here.Since these are ongoing activities or work in progress.The column name here is doingor in progressor you can call by whatever namethat makes sense to you.The last column is all the finished product thatis ready to be shipped to the customer.And this is put under the done column,you can call it completed or finished as well.Thus, theKanban board here is divided into three parts the to do doingor in progress.And lastly the done these indicate the stateof all the activities on the production line.The reason it is called a Kanbanboard is because of the following.We just saw how the moment of inventorywhich is in the form of raw materials or intermediate productsthat exists between the workstations.This process starts the movement ofKanban or cards that are shown in yellow. Here,the cards are constantly exchanged between the workstationsto indicate this moment of inventory that happens between the workstations.Thus creating a constant communicationbetween various workstations through this system ofKB.This practical means of communicationbetween the workstations is vital for one critical reasonto decide to produce or not to produceat every workstation.Without this system of communication,there could be no way to knowhow much should each workstation produceand more importantly when to stop producingas the concept of lean is all about eliminating wasteduring the production process.Any overproduction atany workstation is controlled and almost eliminated by this practical means ofKanban.This is how theKanban board looks only with the cards.The Kanbanboard need not be divided into only three columnsand depending on the need to have a better controlfor the movement ofKanban.Throughout the production process,there could be many more columns as needed.Let's see how theKanban board looks like for a software development project.This is the typical software value streamwith the various stages through which the value flowsinstead of raw materials flowing into the value stream,we have requirementsthat are obtained from the idea or concept of the software to be built.This then goes through the various stages ofrequirements, gathering planning, designing,coding testing and finally deployingas a final product.This is how theKanban boardlooks like for the three columns of to do,which is all the requirements of the software that are to be builtcaptured in this list that looks likea Stack of inventory.Next is the doing or work in progresscolumn where all the work that is currently ongoingand that which the team is working on is shownwhich as you can see isin planning design code, test and review.And lastlyin the done columnis the final deployment of the product featuresto be used by the customer.The doing or work in progress can further be broken down intomultiple states or columns.The way is shown here so that work can be trackedat a more detailed level atthese individual statesthrough which the work passes through the value streamin the software development world. There is no real physical inventorythat moves through the value streamand hence no real cardsto move around when the inventory is moved.Instead, the cards are replaced by actual work itemsthat are performed at each of these workstations.Each of these blocks are work items that the team is actually working onor waiting to work onor have completed.So this is how a Kanbanboard looks like for a software development project.Next,we will see how you can further control each of thesecolumns by allowing only a limited amount of work to take placein each of these states.

The next topic is badge sizes.Now imagine in this production process,you start off the production of chocolate withwith 10 jars of milk, 10 bags of cocoa and almondsand send it through the various workstations downstream.The churning stationproduces 20 jars of a semi liquid which is a mixture of the milk and cocoathat is mixed with the 10 bags of roasted almonds in the mixing workstationand that is sent to the molding station.Let's say this molling station produces 30 boxes of chocolate barsthat are cool to room temperaturebefore it is sent to the final packaging. Some quality checks are performed to testif the productmeets the company's quality standards.The 30 boxes of chocolate that has been produced so farpasses through the quality checks,then is sent to the packaging unitand the final shipment of 30 boxes are made to the customerand this whole process starts all over againwith more inventory to be processed.This one group of raw materials flowing from the start to the finishthrough this valley streamis called a single batch.Now, let's say right before the batch of 30 boxes are packagedduring the quality check. They find thatthe chocolate tastes awfuland is not suitable for shipment to the customer.The reason they find out is that the churning processdid not mix the milk and cocoa to the right consistencywhich has resultedin the final product to taste terrible.This is wasted money in the form of raw materials, the labor, the processing timeand the delay in the lead time to the customer.All of this could have been prevented.If only the quality checks could have been performed earlier.It is extremely expensiveto fix a quality issueif found later in the production process.Hence, it is necessary to have quality checks built in the production processat every step of the wayto avoid costly batch discards.One another way to avoid expensive batch discardis to reduce the size of the badge itself.Imagine if instead of starting with the 10 jars of milk,the 10 bags of cocoa and almonds,the batch was smaller in size, say with just one jar of milk,one jar of cocoa and almonds,which then results intojust three boxes of chocolate candy barsat the cooling station.If a quality issue is found at this point,only three boxes are discarded. Versus the 30 boxes. In the previous case,clearly, the smaller the bad size,the smaller the loss you run into.If things go wrong,how much small,the bad size should be is dependent on the type of the product being produced.And the industry you're inthe optimal bad size depends on various factors. In terms ofthe capacity of the workstations,the bottlenecksin the valley streamand many of the factors that are beyond the scope of this course.But what is important to remember ishaving smaller bad sizes processed through the workstationsis more advantageousthan having larger bad sizesin the software development value stream.An optimal bad size as you will seeis that a minimal set of requirements that the team can build, test and deployas a working codethat benefits the customer immediately upon deployment.

The next topic is another important topic calledwork in progress limits or simply whip limits.Take a look at thisKanban board of our chocolate production process.This is an example of a situationwhere the production process is not balanced anymoreas can be seen atthe molding workstation.There is too much accumulation of workdue to imbalance in the processing timesof the previous workstations that are feeding into the slower workstation.This has to be controlled in order to allow the workstationto complete existing work before new work can be taken.This is done by implementing what are called whip limits.Whip here means work in progress.Whip limits restrict the amount of work a particular workstation can takeat any given point in time.Let's say every workstation here can take only one task at a time.So the wip limitfor each workstation here is onethis is shown in the Kanbanboard as follows.Since there are six workstations inthe doing or webstate,the whip limit can be put as six in the parentheses to indicatethe whip limit cannot exceed six tasks at a time.With the limitation of whip and smaller bat sizes,the overall lead time of the value stream can be made betterand the team can focus on delivering on the work that theycan accomplish doing and not worry about work pile up for them.And as you know, the biggest wastein the world of lean is in fact, waiting in queue to be processed,this waste can be eliminated completelywith the use of whip limits and smaller bat sizeson a factory floor.VIP becomes obvious due to piling of stock in front of workstations.But in the world of softwareVIP has to be forced since it is completely invisible,since there is no physical raw materials to process.This has to be implementedby the team in order to gain the benefits of the of thecompound system.Nowadays, many software tools have inbuilt functionalitythat limits the work in progress.

We are now going to begindiscussing on the topic of Gso far, we learned what is Lean and within it. The Kanban,if this larger circlein red represents the topics within lean,thenKanbanas shown here in green circle sits right within it.A gy that we will learn soon also appears within the larger circle for lean.Because much of what is done in a gileare derived from the concepts of the world of lean.For example, the concept of elimination of waste processing in small batches.The focus on fast flow of work into productionare all the goals ofagile too.Agile usesKanban to its advantage through the visualization of workand limiting bad sizes through whip limits,which is what we learned so far.Some of the benefits that are observed in the world of agile are adapting to changeand continuously improving.And many moreAGat its core is a mindset that is formed by following a set of practicesthat fulfills the values and principles described in the agile manifesto.There are numerous techniques and frameworks built overthe years that all have the same characteristics ofagileand some of these are shown in the smaller circles here.For example,the ScrumXPCrystalScrum Baretcall share the same agile mindset but practiced in different waysas you will learn soon,Scrum is the most common method to manage projects using the agile approach.Let's see how a typical software development projectwas managed before the advent of a job,the typical way to manage such projectsfollowing the predictive approach would have beenas a project manager,you will be chartered to start this projectwith a set of business objectives.There are part of the business case documentthat describe the idea or concept that you're trying to buildwith that business caseand a project charter in hand,you start to formulate a set of requirements obtained from the concept or ideaof what you're trying to build.Typically a full set of requirements are prepared before any project work can startusing these set of requirements.A typical project managerwould go about planning for the project,doing everything we learned so far in the predof approach,doing all the planning up front.Based on the very vague idea of how the teams should be working together.From this point forward, the schedule and budget were likely to be also fixed,forming the iron trianglethat was supposed to be maintained at all costs.Then all the necessary designs areprepared that may involve architectural design planswhere big design decisionswould have been committed atthis point.With those big designs, teams would break up the work and start to develop code.This code would then be builtand then sent to the testerswho come in late in the game to start testing on the codewritten for the full set of requirementsthat the project team prepared up frontright before the product is marked for release. A quality teammay perform some checks.Lastly, the product is deployed or released to the customer as the final delivery.This model worked well for smaller projects where the procedures to create theproduct were so well known and done so many times in the pastthat it became highly predictiveon how the project was to be planned and executed.However,this model would not work for all the projects where there is high ambiguityand those that were being done for the first time of its kindlike our Motor and pestelproject with dronesthat involves high uncertainty and big risksfor it to succeed.According to the often cited Stanish Group's chaos report survey published in 1994a whopping 31% of projects got canceled before they were completed.More than half of the projects costed more than189%.More than the estimated budget,only about 16% projects got completed on time and on budget.And lastly,only 42% of the original features andfunctionalities promised to the customer or sponsorwere deliveredwhen the root cause analysis was done,it was determined that the core issuewas the approachto full requirements definitionthat was expected at the beginning of the project.And that which was fixed,followed by a long gap before any of those requirements were delivered.By the time this set of requirements got built,tested and verified and finally deployed,which could have been months if not years,the expectations of the customer from the product evolved or changed altogetheror simply the technology changed,this resulted in a productthat was no more valuable to the customerare often built with older technology.These were the leading causes of failed projects in those days,the good news,we now have better ways of managing highuncertainty projects through the means of agile approach.As you will see next,how using the concepts of lean projects like thesecan be delivered on time and meet customer expectations.This is done by fundamentally transforminghow we manage requirements themselves.Replacing big upfront plansthat span multiple months, if not yearswith smaller 2 to 3 week focus plansthat are easy to manage and deliver and work onsmall design plansand quick batches of development and testingby a co located team of developers and testersand finally quick increments of working productthen big releases.After many years of waiting, all this is going to change with the introduction ofagile,which is what we will learn next.

The Spanish survey clearly proved the extent ofthe problem facing the software development world.In the 19 nineties,many more projects were doomed to failif the industry continued to do what they were doing all these years.And the contemporary approaches to managingsuch high uncertainty projects were simplynot capable of providing the necessary frameworksto efficiently manage such projects.As you can see,the survey clearly pointed out the extent of the problem.The various approaches available at that timesimply were not sufficientand they were all failed approachesin the month of February of the year 2001,a group of 17 individuals metin the state of Utahin the United Statesto discuss the common problems faced in the world of software development.What came out of this meetingwas a set of values and principlesthat form the foundations of agile.These values are describedin what is called the agile manifesto.This is the manifesto for agile software development.The agile manifesto is a simple set offour values that uncover better ways of developing softwarebut the manifesto not only lists the four values that it wants to advanceusing this new approach.But it also lists the four values from the previous approachesthat were no more suitable in the new world.You see the word over in each of these lines to separate what is better than the other.I am going to draw this line to see what was beforeand what is gonna come afterthe values on the right were valuestraditionally followed all these years on most projectsprior to the year 2001,which as we know by nowwere not sufficient to handle the high uncertainty projects.These values themselves were nothing wrong to followon various projects that they were used.But their over importance on projects and the blind belief to follow themmay have been the primary reasons for the failure of so many projects.The Manifesto clearly lets us know thatit values the ones on the leftmore than the ones on the right.They don't mean that the values on the leftare the exact opposite of what are on the right.The Manifesto also doesn't suggest to completely disregard or neglector eliminate the use of the values on the rightbecause these values do have a placein the way we manage projects.They are there only to show what is now considered to be a better set of valuesover what was previously considered sacrosanct or natural on most projects.For example, the use of processes and toolscomprehensive documentation,contract negotiationand following a plan were considered to be naturalon most projects.Whereas now the agile manifestois suggestingthat these values on the left have more importanceover the ones on the rightimportance should be given to individuals and interactions,working software,customer collaboration and responding to change.For now, just note the four values.Next, we will learn what these mean in detailbehind the Manifesto itselfare a set of 12 core principles that serveas a common framework for all agile methods.These are not the same 12 principles of project management that we learned earlier.These are a set of principles with a different mindsetand we will soon take a detailed look into each of these principles.

We are now going to discuss one of the mostimportant constructs in the software development or technology driven projects.This is the concept of user stories.User stories are the most fundamental seminal constructsin software development.And it is super important to understand this concept.Earlier, you were introduced to what are requirements.As you saw requirements represent somethingthat the software system you're trying to build must doto fulfill the business need.These are functionalities of the product you're tryingto build in the Motor and Pestel app.The requirements of the system is to be able to show nearby homes,cooking food near youshow what cuisines are they offering as homemade foodand more requirements could be something likethe app should show the prices of the fooddelivery methods. And if it is drone based,show in real time, the position of the drone and its estimated arrival time, etc,these are all the requirements of the systemthat must be present to fulfill the business need.In a predictive approach to project management.The requirements are pretty much known early in theproject and do not usually change during the projectfor example, in the pyramids project,we saw that the requirements about the pyramidal structure don't change much.Hence, the team is able totake those requirements and plan around it.However, there is an underlying problemwith the concept of requirementson high uncertainty projects.And that problem is the absence of enduser experience in the framing of the requirements.It is this problem that the concept of user stories tries to solve.Let's see howas the name suggests,these are stories articulated by a userwhen they are asked how they would like the system to beor how they would like the system to function.Think of it like a storyteller telling a story about what the system needs to dofor the userand for their benefit.Since it is a story told by the user,it focuses on the experience of the user and howthe user intends to use the system one day.Hence, the definition of a user story isuser stories are brief statements of intentthat describe somethingthe system needs to do for some user of the system.And in the world ofagile,user stories have a standard constructand they always look like thisas a user roleI canfollowed by the activitythat the user intends to perform in the systemfollowed by.So thatand the rest is the business valueor the benefit how the user intends to derive from using the systemnote this statement always starts with a user.This need not be a human alwaysand can also be in the context of a non humanlike an intermediate system or a module of a larger system.After the comma is the action verbthat the user intends to perform within the system.This is the activity the user performsto derive some kind of a benefit.And that benefit is mentioned atthe end of the user story statement.The business value portion describes what are thebenefits of using the system for thisinternet action or activity within the system?This business valueneed not be expressed in dollar valuesbut simplythe internet benefit for the user.Let's take an example from our Motor and Pestel project.Let's say we ask a user who's going to beusing this app for ordering homemade food from nearby homes.What would the user describe his or her needfrom this app?They can construct a user storyas follows.Let's say the user logs into the appand what they intend to see after that is a list of nearby homes who are cooking food.So the user story becomes like this as a user,I can see nearby homes who are cooking foodso that I can pick the nearest homeand order food from there.It is this user storythat the software team will start to work onthe developers understand what the user story means and startto build the code to implement this user story.Once they have it built for this functionality of the user story,the testers take it upon totest the functionality and see if it functions according to the expectations.If the testers confirm all is good with the functionality,it could potentially be deployedinto the final productso that the end user can immediatelystart to use itand get the internet benefits.Thus,the user stories are the primary objects that carry the customer's requirementsthrough the value stream from concept,through the building of code testing and finally deploying asa final product that is delivered to the customer.

Having understood what I use to.Let's try to see what is a product backlogcomparing this to the factory value stream.The list of all user storiesbecome the inventory of raw materialsthat go into the technology works streamto be processed, checked,testedand delivered to the customer. Inthis case to the end user,the symbol used for the use storiesis so much similarto the Stack of inventorythat are used in the factory value streamand it looks like this.Each rack here denotesa user storythat is stacked up one over the other.We will see later how these user stories are prioritizedso that they can be taken up by the development teamto build code around it.In agile terminology,this Stack of user stories is called the product backlog. Itis called backlog because it is waiting to beprocessed as it flows through the technology value stream,just like the inventory of raw materials waitingto be processed on the factory production line.The product backlog is also called a team backlogbecause this is all the list ofuser stories that the team identified for implementation

This is the topic on project life cycles.So here we are with a set of user storieswithin the product backlog, avalue stream and an end product.What are the various ways we can pass thisinventory of user stories to flow through this value streamand become an end product. Here's where we will discuss the project life cycles.We have four main categories of project life cycles.These arethe predictive lifecycles, the incremental life cycles, it rate of life cyclesand lastlyagile lifecyclesas we will discuss soon,each have their own advantages and disadvantagesare applied based on the needs of the project.

We already saw how a predictive life cycle looks likeit begins with an effort to capture allthe requirements that are needed to execute the projectrequirements as we learned or the functionalities of theproduct you're trying to build through the project.These are the things that the system or the productmust doto meet the expectations of the customer.In order to build this product. The team uses their past experienceand knowledge to formulate all the requirementsand create a vast list of all these requirements asan outcome from what is called as the requirements gathering effort.During this effort,the business stakeholders collaborate with the project teamto identify all the business needs. Imagine what the solution will look likeand createthe necessary requirements list that meets those business needs.The requirements gathering effort concludes oftenwith a fixed set of requirementswhich are assumed to beall the requirements that are necessaryto successfully builda functioning product or service.What is important to rememberis in predictive life cycles.This activity of requirements gathering is performed once for the entire project.And as you can see it is done in the beginning of the project,these requirements form the basis for the development of the project plans.And as you saw earlier,the whole planning phase is dedicated in the development of these plans.These plans then become the basis for the execution of the projectwith the necessary monitoring and controlling procedures. We learned earlierthat happened nextto control the scope cost and budgetthrough the iron triangleand finally ending in the delivery of an acceptable product or service.And if you look at the value stream here,this is all part of the execution of the projectalong with the monitoring and controlling that goes along with it.What you also see is that teams who are workingin that phase of work. For example, the design phasegenerally hand off their work to the team in next phaseand those who are downstream,these handoffs happen all throughoutthe value streamuntilthe product is finally delivered.If anything goes wrong in the downstream activities,let's say at a review phase,there is no easy mechanism for the work to come backto the same team again,for fixing that piece of work.Thus activities happenonly once in each phase of the life cycle.It is important to note that this results in a single deliveryof the end product at the end of this life cycle.For example, in the pyramids project,this was a full life cycle of building the pyramids,the steps as you can see, are pretty predictiveand go through in sequence. As shown here.The tasks and activities to be done in each of these phasesare pretty much well definedand are done according to a plan that isprepared early in the project during the planning phase.Hence, the characteristics of a predictive life cycle arethese are good for projects that have fixed requirements.Typically, these are projectswhich have standard procedures to followand may have been donemany times in the past.The other characteristic is that predicator life cycles have sequential phaseslike the planning phase followed by designcode test, etc,and activities performed in each of these phasesare performed only oncethroughout the life cycle.The next characteristic is thatprimitive lifecycles result in a single delivery of the end productwhen the full life cycle is complete.Lastly,the focus ofpredlife cycles is thatthey are there to deliver projects on timeand within the budgetfor that fixed scopethat was defined in the fixed requirementsthat were captured early in the project.Let's also see how predictive approach can be used for the software projects.This is how it looks like for a typicalsoftware development project.A full set of requirements are captured for the functionality of the systemthat are usually doneearly in the projectby a group of business analystswho talk to various business stakeholdersand prepare the full list of the requirementsthat typically remain fixed for the entire life cycle.Thenall the necessary designsare built by the team memberswhich then become the basis for the developmentorthe building of code that happensbased on those designs.Next to the testers do necessary testingon the codethat is built by the developers with a quick review by the quality folks.And finally ending with the deployment of that code to result in the final product.As we saw earlier, this approach only works for projects that are simple to buildand have fixed set of requirementsthat we don't expect to change over the course of the project.This is typicallythe work that is definable where the requirements are known in advanceand the teams may have worked on similar projects in the past.These are the projects essentially of low risk with highly definable work.Examples of this kind of work are building a simple websitethat may have been built numerous times beforethrough similar projectswhere the process to build is fairly common and known beforehand.

The next topic is iteration and iterative life cycles.Iteration is the heartbeat of a child. It is the heartbeat becausewithout iterationbeing agileis not possibleand it starts to look like any other predictive approach.Let's then see what is iterationand how it happens in an agile environment.This is the value stream in a technology project wherethe concept flows through all these steps in the value streamand ends at the other end to take shape as a working product,you saw that the user stories are the fundamental entityor raw materialthat flows through this value stream,carrying the requirements through the various steps shown here.In a traditional predapproach,you would just keep passingthe user stories to flow through these steps. One after anotherhoping that the functionalities that the coders built all somehowcome together and start functioning as a working product.Nothing is wrong with this approach.But the only problem is thisapproach works only for simple straightforward projectswhere the scope is predefined and fixedand the procedures to create the product are well known.In other words, projectsthat have defined work.This approach fails miserablyfor high uncertainty projects.Let's see whyit is not enough to let the user stories just pass through the value streamon high uncertainty projects.You see software code is not like physical inventory of raw materials.Code is simply a language of the machines thata developer types on a keyboard of a computerto make the computer behave in a certain way,depending on the instructionswritten in the codeBased on how the developer has understoodwhat the user story is about.The code is written accordingly,hoping the machine or computer behaves in that expected way.Every developer has his or her own way of writing codeeven for the same functionality.And therein lies the many disparities that give riseto the risk of things going wrongwith code.And in general building any software application,this is the difference betweena tech value stream versus other value streams like the factory production line.Just to give you another analogyon the factory production line,atoms of raw materials are moved throughthe value stream to create physical products.Like in our example, the chocolate factorywherethe end product was the chocolate candy bars.But here in the technology value stream,electronsthat are part of the atomsconstitute the digital bits that are being movedthroughout the technology value streamto create a digital or a software product.As in our example,the motor and Pestel app,the outputor code from building. The user story needs to be reviewed,assessed and testedto ensure the code is functioning as expected,an acceptance criteria determines if this piece ofcode can be sent further down the value streamfor the final deployment as a final productacceptance criteria is a predetermined set of conditions thatthe functionality that is being built must pass successfullyaccording to the needs of the customer.Let's say the code for this user story isflagged for problems during the review process.This code is then sent backto the previous steps in the value streamfor fixing and further testing.This process is repeated until the code passesthe acceptance criteria.The reason why a piece of code is sent back into the value streamneed not always be an issue with the code.If the results are to be improved,let's say a customer now wants it done in a better way or a different way.That part of the codeis also sent back in the value streamto get it upgraded or improved.According to the latest needs of the customer,this framework of feedback loop where output or codefrom building the user stories is constantly reviewed, assessed,testedand improved is called the iteration.The way an iteration is visually shown in agileis this loopthat circles back to some previous step in the value stream.One more thing worth noting is that the feedback loop that is shown hereneed not always go back to the coding phase.It can go back to any other phase in the upstream,likethe planning phaseor even design phase depending onwhat the issue is in the user story that needs reworkif the functionality being built is not according to the needs of the customerand that, which doesn't meet the exodus criteria.That part of the code or functionality issent back for further revision and improvements.This process is repeated until that functionalitycompletely meets the customer's expectations.Let's do this through an example.The user story that is being coded is tolist all the nearby homes cooking homemade food.Let's say the tests have passed,which means the app lists all the places which are nearbyand those that are cooking food.However, upon review,restaurants also show up as part of the list.Since the acceptance criteria was to list only homesthat are nearby to the user.This part of the codeneeds to be fixed.Hence, the code is sent back to development to fix the functionalityso that only home addresses are listedwith the next iteration.This functionality is fixedand that which meets the acceptance criteria.The last step is to send this part of the code for deploymentinto the final part.This approach of continuously improving functionalitybased on the needs of the customer is calledit alifecycle.The characteristics of an iterative life cycle. Arethat this form of life cycle suits thoseprojects where the requirements are dynamically changing.The other characteristic isthat all activities that are done during each ofthese phases are repeated until they are correct.And according to the customer's needs,the output from iterative lifecycles are usuallysingle deliveryat the end of the iteration.And lastly, the focus in iterative life cycles isto delivera correct solution.A solutionthat is according to the expectations of the customerthat contains no bugs or errorsand works according to the way the customer wants.

Another approach to building a product is the incremental approach.This is where a portion of highly prioritized requirementsand only those requirements in the form of user storiesare sent through the software development value streamto create a quick end productthat the customer immediately wants to start using.Now, let's say these were all the user storiesthat were initially collected as part of the requirements gathering exercise.The team knows that it is not possible to deliverall the user stories that are here in the product backlog.Instead what the team does isit chooses to prioritize afew set of user storiesthat it can build comfortablyin a short span of timeand deliver a working product to the customer.As you can see,these are the prioritized list of your stories that move through the value stream.They finally end upas a working product to the customerif needed. The next set of use storiesare then taken up to create the next increment of the product.The customer knows this is in no waythe final product yet wants a quick working productthat they can have as soon as possibleoften to test out the market if their concept is really going to work.Say, for example, in our Motor and Pestel project, the company wants to experimentwith a prototype version of their app to test in the marketsjust to see how the app will be received by potential users who may be interested inordering homemade food.So the company prioritizes these requirements as their top prioritythat they want to be built developed and deployed as features into the app.Let's say for now, they pick the top five requirementswhich areto find location of the user ordering food, find some nearby homes,cooking foodand list all those food itemsthat the user has selectedand allow the user to pick from the list of product.Let's also say just for the sake of speed of delivery,the company is only interested in the pickup optionand not the delivery option, which as they knowis going to be pretty complicated to implementwhat they then do is allow only these user storiesfrom the product backlog to go through the value stream.So that only these features get built tested anddeployed as a prototype version of the app.This approach where only a selective set ofuse stories are pushed through the value streamto get a quick working productis called the incremental life cycle.This life cycle is optimized for speedrather thandelivering a perfect productto summarize the characteristics of an incremental lifecycle arethis form of approach is suitablewhere the requirements are dynamically changing.Whereas the activities that are done in each of these phasesin the value stream are performed only once for that incrementin the life cycle.As we saw, there may be multiple deliveries in one single increment of the productdepending on the needs of the customer.And lastly, and the most important characteristic of the incremental lifecycle isthat this approach is built for delivering with speed.

Agile lifecycle combines both iterative and incremental life cycles together.What this means is agile products combine speed of deliveryand correctness of product at the same time.Thus delivering a superior product in the fastest possible time.There are two types of agile lifecycles,iteration based agilelife cycleand flow basedlife cyclein iteration basedagile lifecycle.The most important features are identified and prioritizedby the teamto start work on.They plan to complete those features in a fixed duration of time called time boxes.As shown here.A time box is a previously agreed period of timeduring which a team works towards completionof a specific set of prioritized user storiesrather than allow work to continue until the goal is reached.The time box consists of stopping work when the time limit is reachedand evaluating what was accomplishedin that duration.Typically time boxes are limited to about two weeks plus or minus a few days.The important principle of time box is that teamsshould stop working when the time box period endsand review progress on the work that was accomplished in that duration of time boxas you will see later time box is an essential element of many other agile practiceslike the scrumin each iteration, the team works to complete those features,doing whatever necessaryto make those features fully functioning,doing any and as many iterations necessaryto get the product rightand deliver valuein the fastest possible time.Once these features are delivered in that given time,a new set of features are prioritized and pushed through the value stream.Let's say these three arethe top priority user stories that the team has identifiedto push through the value stream and see them created as a working product.As you can see,these are pushed through the value streamthrough the various phases of the life cycleand going through whatever iteration necessaryto make those features rightin doing so, the team has identified this user story needs reworkand hence is sent through another iterationfor improvements.The rest of the stories can pass through the value stream asplanned and all of them eventually are delivered as a working product.When these set of use stories are finished,the next set of user stories are prioritizedand sent through the value streamand the whole process repeats all over again.This is called the iteration based agile life cycle.The second type of agile life cycle is the flow based life cycle.Earlier in the production value stream,we saw how we could limit the amount of work passingthrough each workstation by putting limits to work in progress.As we discussed earlieron the topic of Kanbanboard,we saw how we could limit work by allowing onlya limited amount of work to pass through at each stageon the value stream.In this case,we are limiting work in the coding phase to only three user stories at a time,which becomes the capacity of the codersto perform three user stories at a time.In agile projects that are flow based work in progress limitsor determine and set for a team to work with.This means the teams only take up work based on their capacity to workand not based on what is being pushedthrough what is all in the product backlog.This makes the team focuson making the product better with minimal issues andnot worry about work being pushed to them.But teams that are upstream,let's say we determine the web limit for the coding phaseto be two use stories at a timeas shown here.So the developersthat are assigned to this project can build codeonly for two user stories at a given time,which is what is shown hereas the web limit.This can be done for every phase in this project, including the testers,the reviewers, etc.Hence the capacity of the developers is to use storiesin one given iteration.Now let's see how the user stories flow through this weblimitedvalue stream.As you can see the use stories flow through each phase in this life cycleand are then taken up by the developers.We're the only code for these two user stories at a given time.These user stories then flow through the rest of the phases in the life cycleand are then deployed as a final product.This process then repeats for the remainder ofthe use stories in the product backlog.But what is important to note is thatthe number of user stories that are flowing through agiven life cycleis limited bythe whip limits that are put in place by the teamsthat is comfortable to themand on which that they can focus and deliver a working product.

We looked at various life cycles for taking a conceptand converting it into a working product.How do we decide which approach suits the needsof the project that depends on two main things.The first is the degree of change during the projectchange. Here means to what extent will the requirements change during the project?And how often will the customer's needschange based on the changing market conditions?And with what speed is the technology itself changing inthat area of work that the project is being done?The second is frequency of deliveries,which is how oftencan the project deliver to the customer?Let's put this on a chartwith a degree of change on the X axisand the frequency of deliveries on the Y axis.Lower degree of change means these types of projects are well defined,their procedures well known to the teams and the product that the projectis trying to build may have been built numerous times in the past.The other end ofthe X axis is projectsthat have a high degree of change.The Y axis starts witha single delivery of the final product at the end of the projectgoing all the way above with frequent deliveriesall throughout the project.Typically,projects which have a low degree of changein their business requirements and the technical requirementsare those projects where the delivery happens only once at the end of the project,once everything is built.And these are the projects that lie inthis region.Examples are projects for building structureslike skyscrapers, malls, airports or even our pyramid examplein the technology world.These could be projects like building small websites where thecontent and design is known in advance or is takenand simply off the shelf from prebuilt templates.These are the projects that follow the predictive life cycle.The other region in this chart is occupied by the adaptive lifecycles.Adaptive life cycles are where the team adapts to the changing needs of the project.An example of an adaptive lifecycle is the incremental lifecyclewherethere is low degree of change in the requirementsand those projects may have multiple deliveries requested by the customer,the higher the degree of change on a project.The more the uncertainty on the project in terms ofmanaging changes to the scope and requirementsand the technical complexity of building aproduct based on those changing requirements.This is where the iterative lifecycle fallswhere there is a high degree of change,but there is a single delivery that happens at the end of the iteration.But projects that have a high degreeof change and frequent deliveries all throughoutthe life cycle of the project are those that fall in this region.These are projects that follow the agile life cycles.Let's understand this through some examples.The pyramid project lies here in this regionof predictive life cycles.This is becausethe degree of change in the scope of this project is prettyminimal and it ends with a single delivery of the completed structure.The Motor and Pistol App that we are trying to buildis probably in this region.It is in this region because itis a comparatively simple projectto build such an app because similar efforts may have been done in the past.And the teams have a good understanding of how to build these kind of apps.Hence building the Motor and Pestel App may not be a truly agile project.A project that is truly agile in naturecould be the Motor Pestel app through dronesbecausethis is a project that involves aneffort that is filled with uncertainties and risksdue to the use of totally new technologythat has never been done before. Hence, the degree of change on such projects is highand in order to delivera functioning working product,the team has to have multiple deliveries through much experimentationthat may involve a lot of prototypes all along the waywith improvements made throughout the life cycleuntil a final working product is delivered.This is the continuum of all the possible life cycles that are usedfor converting a concept into a working product.And as you can see, this continuum is a canvasthat you can use to plot the nature of your project based onthe degree of changes and the frequency of deliverieson the project.Since this is a continuum,there are areas on this canvas that are common to multiple types of life cycles.In fact, your project can start inone region of the life cyclethat could be used in the beginning of the projectand then move into the other regions of the life cyclesbased on the changing needs of the projectand eventually end with an altogether a different life cycle completely based onwhat is truly happening on the projectand adapt to those needs.This continuum of life cycles also gives rise tohybrid life cycles, which is what we will discuss next.

You can combine multiple approaches of life cycle planningdepending on the needs of your project.As you can see the various approaches of how you do your projectsintersecton this continuum of lifecycles.By the time your project moves fromthe concept phaseto a full working product,it can move from one type of life cycle to another type.Imagine your project starting off in this phase atthe beginning of the project and then moving intoa different continuum of lifecycle.When the project ends,this is where you can start to use the hybrid lifecycles,which are a combination of multiple life cycles that you can use on a single projectdepending on where you are in the project. And what type of scope is being worked on.You can decide to choose an approach that is suitablefor an optimum delivery of value.When you mix multiple approaches together, you get to do your projectin more interesting ways through what are called ashybrid lifecycles.Let's see how these hybrid lifecycles look like.You can do projects where the first phase of the projectis done using the agile approachfollowed bya more predictive approachin the later phase of the project.As shown here.This is typically the case where your project is going to deliver a productthat needs regulatory or external oversight for its approval and use,which most often happens in drug development projects in the pharmaceuticalindustry where a formal approval from regulatory authorities like the FDAin the United Statesis necessary to put a product into market.Let's take another example using our Motor and Pestel project with drones.The early stages of the project has to beagile because of its high uncertainty and cross functional team collaborationneeded to build a working product.The end product is gonna be an app that delivers food through the use of droneswhich fly in open skies.Although these drones will rarely be sharingthe same space as the commercial flightsandother regulated airspaces.Their use for delivery of food will most certainly need government approvals.This is where the project enters into the predictive approachwhere the approvals from the government are obtainedin the traditional project management style.Using the waterfall methodology.The government may need extensive amount ofdocumentation in the form of test reports,risk assessments and so on.To ensure the product is not going to become a danger to the publicin the United States. You can expectthe project team to engage withthe government bodies like the FAA,which is the FederalAviation Authoritythat approves the use of drones for this purpose.Hence,the project team would most certainly start off witha full fledged agile approach till the point,a working product is builtafter the agile lifecycle ends hereand move into the predictive approachto obtainthe approvals from the government.It is also possible to have projects done the otherway round that is first start off with the predictive approachand then move intothe agile approachin companies where there is huge bureaucratic stepsto get a project approvedfrom various teams.The project manager may start off the project in a more predictive fashionto engage in various stepsto obtain the initial approvalssay for example, from the finance teamwork with the procurement teamto start engaging with the various vendorsthat the company is approved to work withand even a clearance from the legal team to initiate the project.Once these approvals are obtainedat the end of the predicator lifecycle,the project team can switch into the agile modeto start building the product itself.There are other combinations of hybrid life cycles that are possibledepending on the scope of the projectand the nature of work on the project.The project manager can decide to lay out the approachon what is the best combination of the hybrid life cycles.Here's an example of a largely predictive approach that isused all throughout the project from concept to product.However,with portions of scope executed through the agile approach.On the other hand,this is a hybrid life cycle wherethe project largely follows an agile approachwith some portion of scope executedthrough the predapproach.Whatever the combination of the hybrid life cycle is,the underlying principleis thatthe delivery of value from the concept phaseto the time a working product is created,the lifecycle is optimizedto match the needs of the project. Thus givingvarious tools and techniques for the project manager to work with.

The product backlog is an importantasset in the development of software applicationswhich as we saw are the inventory of user stories.It is important to now learnabout the person who owns the product backlog.Just like on the factory production line,the inventory of raw materials are owned by someonebecause these raw materials arean important assetthat are to be tightly controlled and managed.All inventory is accounted for by someone responsiblefor maintaining the raw materials that move intothe workstations because they not only cost alot of money for the factory to purchaseand maintain, but when they're releasedin an uncontrolled fashion into the production line,they cause immense problems during the production process.Similarly, on the tech projects,someone has to own the inventory,which in this case is the inventory of requirementsand someone who can be accounted for it.This critical roleis called the product owner.This as you know by nowis the technology value streamwhere the user stories that are part ofthe product backlog flow into the value stream inthis way,in the iterative fashion that we discussed earlierand finally ending in a product,the product owner is often abbreviated topthe product owner owns the backlog in its entirety.What this means is the product owner is responsiblefor everything that is in the product backlog.He or she also owns what goes into the product backlogand what goes out of the product backlog as wellinto the value stream.He or she is a person who controls this flow ofwhat goes into the value stream.In what orderare the user stories listed in the product backlog,which basically is the prioritization of user storiesis also owned by the product owner,the business valuethat is associated to each of these user stories. And lastlyhow big or small in order of relative size to each user storywithin the product backlog is also the responsibility of the product owner.As you can see, this role is a critical role in an agile projectbecause the product backlogis a starting point for the generation of valuein the value stream.All value flows from hereas it goes through the various stages of requirements, gathering planning,development testing and finally deployment during the softwaredevelopment life cycle until a product is built.It is a product owner who sets the direction of this productin doing so,the product owner needs to interact with various stakeholders on the projectto maintain a healthy working product backlog.And what this means iseverything that is within the product backlogis fully understood by the team prioritized in a waythat is according to the business value that is delivered by each user story.In the product backlog,appropriately sized and planned to be moved into the development value stream.To do this. The product owner works closelywith the business stakeholdersto understand their requirements which is usuallyconveyed in the form of their intentand the business value that the functionalitiesthat are planned to be delivered.That intent as we saw is translated into a user story, which by definitionisthe brief statement of intentof what the user needs in the systemand that is captured in the form of user stories.These are called the functional requirements.Since they are related directly to the functionality of the product being built,the product owner may also interact with other members of the project team,like the architects and various engineers on the projectto further elaborate on not just the functional requirementsbut also on nonfunctional aspects of the features being built,things that enable the core features to function well,like the underlying system architecture, user interface and designand security needs of the product.One example of a user story you can imaginethat may come from the security team of the projectis as a user,I can securely save my personal data in the app sothat I save time when I order food the next timethis is something that is not a core functionality of the system,but still an essential featureof the appwithout which the personal data of users may be compromised.These type of requirementsthat are not directly requested by the end users of the product are captured aspart of another category within the productbacklog called as the non functional requirements.As you can see,the product owner is responsible for not only the functional requirementsof the product backlogbut also the nonfunctional requirements. As shown here,it is the job of the product owner toensure all these requirements are properly understood by the teamsized. According to the capacity the team can work onand properly converted into a working product.All this the product owner has to dowithminimum amount of wasteand the waste could be in the form of scope creep for featuresthat may have been inserted into the product backlogthat may not have any valueand with no utility to the end user.Therefore,the product owner is key to the delivery ofa successful product that has the highest business value.

Agilemindset is the way of thinking and behavingbased on the four values described in the agile Manifestoand the 12 principles of agile.The four values as described in the agile manifestoare internalized and made it part ofan agile thes collective character.That is when you can saythe team has an agile mindset.What this means is the team as a whole willalways prefer the values on the left of the agile manifestoversus the values that are on the rightand constantly work in being in that state.From this mindset,an agile team functions with a set of software development methodologiesbased on iterative developmentwhere requirements and solutions evolve throughcollaboration betweenself organizing cross functional teams.Agile methods promote disciplined project management processesthat encourage frequent inspectionand adaptation.These methodsalso promote teamwork, self organization and accountability.And lastlyhaving an agile mindset is having a set ofpractices intended to allow rapid delivery of high quality softwarethat aligns development with customer needs and company goals.It is all about being in a state. You're ready to take direct actionon things happening on the project.Be able to react quicklyon things that mayderail the project.And lastly having a teamthat has maximum adaptabilityand flexibility.

There is a concept in agilemindsetthat is about how you serve even in the position of leadershipin the beginning. This may appear to be a contradictory termbecause our understanding of leadership iswe think of it asthe opposite of servitude,servant leader is about working with a purpose,serving to uplift your teamand promoting processes that enable the delivery of valueas a servant leader. Your role is to work with a purposeand that purpose is driven bythe ambitionto succeed as a team.Your role is to uplift your team and help them joyfully achieve their goalswhen they succeed, you succeedand the whole team succeedswhen you choose to serve first.It is for the other person's benefit.You selflessly focus attention away from yourselfand put the spotlight on others.Leaders operating from this mindset, get the best out of their teamsbeing a servant leaderin practical terms. Looks like thisa servant leaderwho removes obstaclesthat make it hard for employees to do their workas a servant leader. You provideinformation,technology and resourcesand support the team to do great workas a servant leader.You always ask,how may I help youor what can I doto help you to be successfulin that position of servant leadership?You find opportunities to develop people skillsand you lead withemotional intelligence.And lastly,as a servant leader,you have a clear vision of future to be able to execute the projectand deliver value as promised to the customer.

We saw beforethat user stories are the fundamental construct throughwhich value flows through the adjoint life cycle.But the user stories are only inanimate pieces of informationthat someone wished to be converted into a product one day.Thus,the user stories are themselves useless without thepeople who can understand the intent behind them,convert them into working codeand build them into a working product.The next topics are all about who are the peoplethat make the backbone of an agile teamin the software development world.The fundamental purpose of an agile theme is to write andtest all code that delivers value to the end user.That is how value is generated through the value stream.Since testing software is integral to the delivery of valuetesters are central to the delivery of valuein an agile team.It is important to note thatcode that has been not testedis of little value in an agile environmenteven though it might have been moved through the value streaminto the final product.But unless that piece of code is fully testedand confirmed as a working product,there is zero value delivered from that piece of codeat its core, an agile team consists of three distinct roles.The first is a product owner. As you saw earlier,the role of a product owneris unique and importantin an agile team.The product owner is responsible for determining and prioritizinguser requirementsand maintain the product backlog in its entirety.This is the person who sets the directionof the product but continuously organizing teams workaround a single prioritized backlog.The next role is cross functional team members.This is a group of individuals made up of developers, testers,designers, architects, business analysts, andkey people from the functional sidewho understand the business well,these are the people who are co located and work togetherto define build, test and deliver user stories as working product.The next role is a team facilitator.This is a person who is a servant leader whose role is to assist the teamto continuously facilitate a team's collaborationto maximize performance of the team.This servant leadercould be called a project manager,a Scrum master,a team leaderetc.

Since project managers in an agile environmentfunction as team facilitators,they have a unique role that is distinct fromthe traditional project management.You have already learned that the project manager is the leader on the project.Project managers are expected to displayleadership trades to lead the project with authority, integrity and expertise.There is one another characteristic of a project managerthat becomes importantin the agile environmentand that isthe trait of humility.It is humility that keeps things in checks.If the project manager isleaning towards authoritarian or dictatorial approachto managing team members on the projects,agile gives a name to this traitthat is expected to be part of the mindset while leading agile teams.And that trait is servant leadershipin a matrix structure.You saw how projects borrow resources from various functional departmentsof the organizationto execute on the project.The key difference in an agile environment is that these cross functional teamsthat are coming from various functional departmentsbecome self organizedand they reorganize when necessary based on the work in the product backlogin the traditional project management approach thoughit was the project managerwho was tasked with ensuringthe team's work according to the project planand organizebased on the governance set by the project manager.That is a key difference between a traditionalproject done in the predictive approach versus projects donein an agile environment.Some of the characteristics of an agile team are thatthe agile team members are all co located.What that means isthey typically tend to reside physically in the same locationso that there is closer collaboration between the team members.Agileteams are typically of the size of 5 to 7 people maximumwith the three major roles discussed earlieror an absolute minimum,which consists of the product owner and the teamfacilitator who may be project managers or Scrum masters.Agileteams are 100% dedicated to the project,which means that at one given point,they work on one single project.And lastly,agileteam members are not allowed to multitaskbecause that spreads the focus thin for the team memberswhich then impacts the productivityand the overall throughput of the project.You can think of agile teams as fish in a fish bowl.This analogy is used to describe an agile team becauselike the fish in a fish bowl which are visible to everyone outside the bowl.The work done by the agile team membersis always transparentand visibleto everyone within the team and outside the team,all the work that is done by the agile team members is hence trustworthyand reliable.

You now know that iteration is the heartbeat of a child.It is the ability to take a set of user stories from a backlogand build those storiesinto a working productdelivered within a fixed time box.The goal of each iteration is the sameto build an increment of a working productthat is of value to the customer.All iterations can be broken down intodistinct phases of work as can be seenin the stage is shown in different colors. Here,during these phases of work,there are some practices and rituals that the agile team follows.This is what we will learn next.The product backlog is the list of allrequirements that have come in from the business stakeholdersand that which is moderated by the product owner.It is also calleda team backlogbecause it is what the agile team will work on in this iteration.This product backlog serves asthe to do list for the team,just like any other to do list.This list of items needs to be prioritized.This is becausethe team's resources are limited by the number of people who are working,who are usually not more than 5 to 7 people in a typical agile team.And since an agile iteration is about two weeks in length,that translates to about 80 hours of duration for those seven peoplefor the first iteration or increment of the product,the product owner has to match the capacityof these 5 to 7 peopleto how many requirementscan actually be pulled out of the product backlog to be worked uponnote, the team is only focused onwhat to workon the first iterationthat they can deliver in the next two weeksand not the entire final product.This is where the iteration planning starts.The team begins the iterationwith the planning phase during which it reviewsthe user stories in the product backlog,understands the intent behind the user stories.And from that makes an estimationof how much of work will each of the user story be to the teamand assign priorities to the user stories based on the business value delivered.They even add or remove user stories based on the current project context.On this diagram. The iteration planning happens here.The objective of this planningbefore the iteration starts is to define andaccept a reasonable scope for the next iteration.This effort to make the work ready for the upcoming iteration is calledbacklog preparation and refinement.During the preparation and refinement effort.There is a lot of negotiation that happensbetween the product owner and the development team.The negotiation is aboutwhat the team can and cannot commit for the next two weeks,which is typically the duration of the duration.This negotiation results in a commitment by the development teamand a promise to deliver a tangible scopein that duration ofthe small time box,which is about two weeks.The underlying mindset here is that every personon the team is agreeing to the commitmentmade to deliverthat scope of work.This is not something like you would typicallysee where a project manager forces a teamto agree to workon an arbitrary scope of workin an arbitrary duration of time.Here, the team themselves commit to delivering that piece of scopeas an incrementin the form of a working product.This planning and refinement happens at thebeginning of every iteration in an agile lifecycleand is critical as a practicein an agile lifecycle.The result of this backlog preparation and refinement processis thatthe team obtains what is called as the iteration backlog.The iteration backlogis a derivative of the product backlog,meaning that it containsthe prioritized user storiesthat the team has finally committed to work in this iteration.The stories in the iteration backlog are the ones that the team has committed toto be deployed as a final product.This is the list of use stories that will go into the iterationthat will be designed coded tested reviewed and demonstrated as a working featurebefore it is pushedas a working product.

Before those set of featuresare released as a working product.There is another practice that is followed by the team members which is todemonstrate the features that the team has built so far in this iteration.The demo is given by the team to the product ownerand other business stakeholders who are there toconfirm if the features are according to their expectationsthat they wish to see in the final product.The importance of this practiceis to obtain immediateand constant feedback about the usefulness of the features being built by the teamand also the correctness of the features as per the expectations of the customeror the end user.This review of the work done so farby the team is very useful to course correct the direction of the product life cycle.If any changes are to be made to the feature set,those become the updated set of user stories that go into the next iteration.This is the benefit of doing frequent demosthroughout the agile life cycle.

The team doesn't just start working on the next iteration.Right after the demonstration happens,there is one another practice that is done before the end of every iteration.And that isiteration retrospective.The goal of the retrospective isto look for lessons learned during the previous iterationso that the team can use that to adapt and improve in the next iteration.This is a session that is led by the team facilitatorwho is often called a Scrum master or even the project manager.The team facilitatorfacilitates a time boxed meeting for about 30 to 40 minutes.And this is a meeting that gives a chance to the teamto think retrospectand more importantly,learn from the previous work done so far in the previous iterations,things like what went well in the previous iterations,what didn't go welland what can be done to do better? Next timeare the type of questions askedin this retrospective meeting.

If iteration was the heartbeat of agility on a project.The rhythm to that heartbeat is seen in a ritualthat is common to most agile themes.And that ritual is calledthe daily standupsto represent daily stand ups. In this diagram, a small loopis added to the existing loop of iteration. As shown here,the daily standups are quick 15 minute meetingsthat happened dailyand involves all the team members of the project with no exceptions.Since a typical agile team is of the size of 5 to 7 people.All those people are expected to be part of the daily stand ups.The goal of this meeting is to provide quick updatesof all the work that is done by all the team membersand all that is done while standing up. Hence the name daily standups.The standups purpose is to share infoabout the progress of the work made in that iterationand communicate and collaborate on daily activities.TheKanban board comes in very handy for discussing much of the progress madeas you saw earlier.Kanban is a visual tool that clearly shows all progress madeon the project.It shows which use stories are in what stage of the iteration,how many user stories are waiting to be processed?Who are all the people waiting for work to be done?And more importantly,where are the bottlenecksin all the work that is done by the agile team?All this is done in the 15 minutes fast paced meeting.After the meeting, everybody goes back to their work,clear headed and focused on what needs to be done for that day.

A term that often comes up in theworld of product development is minimum viable productor MVP.Imagine you're asked to build a devicecalled the earthquake detection kit.In scientific terms, it is called a seismograph.A seismograph detects earthquakes by detecting theslightest tremors in the earth's crust.So the concept you're working here with isto build a productthat is to detect earthquakes.An actual seismographis a complicated piece of equipment as shown here.If you are part of a team building this complicated piece of scientific instrument,it is going to take a long time for you to build this productfrom the conceptto the final product and show something to the customer.So instead of this, your team decidesto build this version of the seismographwhich contains the basic underlying featuresthat are behind the complicated scientific instrumentsthat you see here on the rightto simplify things. Here are the major partsthat make up the seismograph.I won't go into the full scienceof how a seismograph works,but basically when there is an earthquake,the shock waves from the earthquake cause this pendulumthat is attached to a string vibrate,the larger the earthquake, the larger the movementof this pendulum.The pen under this pendulumcontains ink that writes on the paper below it.Thus recording the waves from the earthquake on the paper.The intention here is not to understand how a seismograph worksbut rather seewhat the team can deliveras a pre version of the final productthat still has the same capabilities as the final product.This version of the product is clearly not the final product yet.It demonstrates the concept of detecting earthquakesand is immediately useful to the customer.In other words, this is of immediate value to them.This precursor version of the final productthat delivers a tangible value to the customeris calleda minimum marketable productor MMP.And the features that make upthis productare calledminimum marketable features or MMF.Now take a look at this productthat is even beforethe MP.This is basically the same earthquake detection kitbut made simply with two wiggly eyesand a piece of paper.This product can also detect earthquakes.This is the extreme minimum,you can build an earthquake detection kit.This is called a minimum viable product or MVP.I'm using this extreme exampleto explainwhat is an MVP where the product the teamhas built is nowhere near to the final productyet. It demonstrates the conceptbehind what the product isand the use of the ideaon which the product is being built.The team builds an MVP to validate their effortsthat they are working on.And to confirm thatthe idea behind the product really works.It also gives the team to learn quickly fromthe product they're building however crude it may beand to learn about the product,it also gives them a chance to improve through various iterationsbased on the MVPand work towards creating the final polished product.Therefore,the MVP is a version of the finalnew product that represents the core value propositionwhile allowing the team to learn about the product. And at a really low cost,as you can see from this exampleto make the earthquake detection kit,the team may have spentonly a couple of dollarsin making this MVP.The difference between A MVPandthe MPis thatthe minimum marketable product has featuresthat can be marketed,sold and shipped to the customerand is usually of high quality and usabilityto the customerin comparison to the MVP,which is usually very crudeand not of high quality.That is the reason whythe MP is sometimes calledthe potentially shippable increment of the productor P SIThe difference also is thatthe MMP provides a tangible value to the customer.Whereasthe MPis a version before the MP purely for the team to learn from it quicklyand improvise on itat every stage of the next iterationof the following iterationthat comes later.

In reality, not all mps are so simple to build,they may involve a lot of work by the team membersto obtain the first version of the MVP itselfafter multiple cycles of iterationthat involves design, coding,testing and review process.Let's take a look athow the MVP will look like. In our example, the Motor and Pestel project,which isan appthat delivers homemade food.The original idea of this app is thatanyone can order homemade food sitting in their homesand expectthe food to arrive at their doorstepsthrough the use of droneson the right. What you see is the final end productfor the Motor and Pestel homemade food delivery app.There is a refined and beautiful app to order homemade foodthat looks like this.And then there is the drone itselfwhich delivers foodjust like the seismograph.This is also a complicated systemwith high end technology in usebehind the app itselfand the use of drones for delivery,it may take years for the team to deliver on this final productgiven the complexity in building itand the rigorous regulatory oversight and approvalsneeded in getting this off the ground.This is the minimum marketable product or MPof the Motor and Pestoapp,which as you can see is still the refined versionwith the redesigneduser interface.But without the dronesgiven the pressures on the company to put a product in the market soon,the minimum marketable product may be the versionthat the team might want to put out in order to meet the deadlines.The MP, which is of high qualityis the product that can deliver business value with tangible benefitsin a shorter period of time. In comparison to the full final productthat the company wishes to put out eventuallygoing even further back here is the MVP or theminimum viable product of the same motor and Pestel app.As you can see, this is the cruder version of the motor and Pestel app.The user interface or UI is very simple.The visuals are hand drawn and the app is not optimized for a great user experience.However, itis a working app with the core features built into the app.The intention here is not to ship this product to the market,but rather the MVP here is for the team totest out the app with a small group of customersto see if the core idea of the business is feasible and executable,which wasto enable people order food from various homes around them.It may take multiple iterations after the MVP for the team to arrive atthe first version ofthe MMP, which can be put out in the marketto start generating revenue for the company. And from there,it could take many more iterationsfor the company to reach the final productwhich involvesthe full scope of building an app that involves drone delivery.

The next topic is Scrum.Scrum is the most common agile project management framework.It is widely used because of its lightweight framework.Scrum is a way for a team or an organizationto respond to complexity and to changethat cannot be predictedand to move quicklythrough a constantly changing problem space.Let's first see what is Scrum made up of.What you see here is the illustration ofthe entirety of Scrum.There's an easy way to understand Scrumand that isthrough the 353 structure.Let me explain what this means.Scrum at its core is made up of only three fixed rolls, five eventsand three artifacts.Let's see what these mean.The three roles in Scrum arethe product owner,the Scrum masterand the Scrum team.The product owner is a person with a vision to build the product.The product owner is a proxy for the customer or the business stakeholderand is the one who usually knows about the productbetterthan anyone else from a functional standpoint.The product owner understands the risks, the business valueand the gain to be made by delivering the product.The next person is a Scrum master.The Scrum master is a role who will coach the rest of the teamthrough the Scrum frameworkand will act as the team facilitatorto get things doneand to remove anything that's blocking the team.And lastly is the Scrum team,which consists of people who do the work in termsof building the product by converting the vision into reality,creating the necessary code.If it's a software development projectand converting the concept into cashthrough the delivery of a working product.The Scrum team is smallwith about 3 to 5 peopleat the mostthat consists of the developers and the testers.Hence the total number of people in a typical Scrum teamis about 5 to 7 people.The next in the Scrum frameworkare the five events.The five events arethe sprint itself.Second is the sprint planning. Third is the sprint review.Fourth is a retrospectiveand fifth is the Daily Scrum.The sprint begins withthe sprint planningwhich is when the team begins the iteration byreviewing the user stories in the product backlog,understands the intent behind every user story.And from that makes an estimation of how much of workwill each of the users to retakefor the team to work on?They also associate certain business valuearound each user storythat then ties intothe priority behindwhat needs to be done and what notduring that sprintthe objective of the sprint planning isto define and accept a reasonable scopefor this sprint.The sprint planning also involves backlog preparation and refinementresulting into the sprint backlogwhich is a list of all the items that the team is committing to work in this sprint.The print itselfis a framework where all the work happens in a time box.Typically around 30 days from the timethe team has started to work on the sprint planning,then going intothe design code test reviewin the final deploymentinto a product increment.This time box is called the print.The work that is gonna be done in this print is fixed,which means thatonce the scope of the sprint is committedin the form of a sprint backlog,no additional functionality can be addedexcept by the agreement of the development team.The next event airs the sprint review.This is where the team gets a chance to demonstratethe product that they have built so farto the customer and obtain immediate feedbackabout the feature set that they have built.The next event is the retrospective.The goal of the retrospective is tolook for lessons learned during the previous sprintso that the team can use that to adapt and improve in the next sprint.Typically, the scrum master facilitates this meetingwhich lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.In the retrospective meeting,the teams discusswhat went wellin the previous print.What didn't go well, what can be done to do better? Next timein the next printare all the type of questions asked in the retrospective.The next event is The Daily Scrum,which is also called as the Daily Stand Up.The Daily Stand Up in Scrum usually lasts for about 15 minutes.The Daily Scrum is a good place to discuss the progress made so far on the printand gives the team a chance to communicate and collaborate on daily activities.The next are the three artifactsthat are used in the Scrum framework.Those arethe product backlog,the sprint backlogand the product increment.As we saw earlier, the product backlog is all the work that is to be done on the projectwhich includes all the requirements from the customer.There are in addition to the functional requirements may containnew requirements, infrastructure and design requirementsand any defect workload.The sprint backlog is same as the iteration backlog,which is the refined version of the product backlogafterthe team has prioritizedand sized the user stories appropriatelyand have committed to start work on those user stories.Those constitutethe sprint backlog.The last artifact is a product incrementwhich is a pre version of the final productas a result ofthe team working ona small set of user stories that were prioritizedand implemented through this sprint.As in any agile project,the Kanbanboard comes in very handy for discussing all the progress that is madein the Scrum framework.This is called a Scrum board.The Scrum board is a visual board that clearly shows all progresson the sprint.It shows which use stories are in what state,how many are waiting in each phase of the projectand what stories have been completed so far.This is all shown in the Scrum board.Therefore, as you can see,the Scrum frameworkis a very simpleagile project management framework that is basedon the 353 structure as discussed.The Scrum so far has proven to be themost effective framework to execute on agile projects.

We will now discuss another concept called as the definition of donein agile projects.It is important to establish a clear definition of done so that everyoneon the team has a good understanding of what needs to be doneto consider work completeand to ensure that the team is delivering high qualityshippable increments of work at the end of each iteration.This is the concept of the definition of donedefinition of done is a set of acceptance criteriathat a user story featureor a product increment must meet before it is considered completeand that which is ready to be delivered to the customer.What you see here is an example where a team is working on, let's say two sprints,sprint onefrom here to here,sprint two from here to here and soon with increments of product delivered to the customerat the end of each sprint.As you know, product increment isis a subset of the final productwith a set of prioritized featuresthat the customer is looking forward to from the agile teamand that which has some value to the customer.Hence the definition of done becomes critical in how theteam plans to deliver each product increment to the customer.In order to keep the customer happy at the end ofeach sprint where product increment is delivered to the customer.The definition of doneshould be specific and measurableand that is donethrough ensuring that the definition of done meets these following criteria.That definition of done should ensure thatthese product increments at the end of each printmeet the following criteria ofall required functionality have been implemented and tested.All code has been reviewed and meets the team's standards of quality.All necessary documentation has been completed.And lastly,the product increment has been demonstrated to thecustomer and any necessary feedback has been incorporated.And as you sawas part of every sprint,the team does a demonstration ofthat product increment to the customer.This way, the customer knows what is part of that product incrementand use that opportunity to provide any necessary feedback to the teamthat could be incorporated for further improvements.Therefore,the definition of done serve as a reference point for the development teamto help ensure that the product increment meets the required quality standardsand is ready for use by the customer.

Earlier, when we were discussing the role of the product owner,we learned that the product owner controls the flow of the user storiesinto the technology value stream.But how does a product owner knowwhat user stories to prioritize?And which ones to let the team start working onas a priority?This is doneby usinga method to estimate the relative size or complexity of user stories or tasksin agile software development project.A story point is a unit of measurethat is used to estimate the relative size and complexity of a user storyor a product backlog item.The product owner always has to find a way for the teamto estimate how much work is involved in completing a user storyand that which the team would start working on in that iterationthat is done using story points.There are several ways to explain story points in an agile project.The most common is through the use of Fibonacci sequence.AFibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each numberis the sum of the two preceding numbers.The Fibonacci sequence begins with the number zero. But as you know, every use storytakes some effort to work on.Hence, the real story points begin with the next number, which is one.In order to obtain the next number in the Fibonacci sequence,you add the previous two numbers in this case zero and one.So the next number would be one which is same as the previous number.The next number would be simply addingone and one to give two.The next number would bethe sum of one and two, which is three,next one would be two plus three, which is five813 and so on. Inthis approach, the team assigns a numberto each user storybased on its relative size or complexity.Let's say the first user story in this productbacklog is assigned a value of one story pointbecause of its relative sizeor complexity.The team then comparesthe other use stories in comparisonto this use story, whether it is more larger or complexin relation to the first use story. If the other use storyis more larger or complex,the team then continuethis process of assigninga numberto all the use stories in the product backlog.For example, a use story that is estimated to be eight story pointsis considered to belarger or more complex than a user story that is estimatedto be worth five story points.The team can use these estimates to plan and track their workand to make informed decisionsabout how much work they can reasonably take in one given iteration. Itis important to note that story point estimatesare subjective and they are not an indicator ofthe real work in terms ofthe amount of time spent on each user story or the number of peopleneeded to get that user story built.These are simplyrelative numbers assigned to use stories in the product backlog.They're not meant to be precise estimates of thetime or effort required to complete a task.Instead,they're used to provide a common frame of reference for theteam and to help them plan and track their work.There are other ways to estimate and assign story pointsto user stories in a product backlog.Another way that is used commonly is the use of planning poker.Each team member is given a set of cards with numbers on themto represent different levels of complexity.The team members then use these cards to estimate the size of each user story.

Another important measurementin an agile project is the velocity. Itis used to track the progress of a projectand to help the teamunderstand how much work they can realistically takein any given iteration or sprintvelocity is usually measured in terms of the numberof story points that a team can complete in agiven iteration.A story point as we saw is a unit of measurethat is used to estimate the relative size or complexityof a user storyin a product backlogto calculate velocity.The team adds up the total number of storypoints that were completed in a given iteration.This number is then used to predict how muchwork the team can complete in future iterations.Velocity can be a useful tool for project managers and team members becauseit helps them understand how much work the team is capable of completingin a given period of time.It also helps them identify any potential bottlenecks orissues that may be slowing down the team's progressand take corrective action to improve the team's efficiency.It is important to note that velocity isonly a tool by which teams manage themselves.It is not a tool for the management to use velocityas a measure of team's performance on the project.

Now, let's talk about how to get started with Scrum.It's a simple process with 10 steps involved in it.And as long as you follow these 10 steps,you should be able to quickly set up a Scrum team.The first three steps are to pick the three important roles on the Scrum team.First step, you need to pick a product owner.This person is a visionary leader who has aclear idea of what you're trying to achieve.They know what's possible and what risks to watch out forand they're passionate about the project.That's the kind of personyou need to pick as a product owner.Next, you will need a team of people who will actually get the work done.So the second step isto pick a team,this team should have all the necessary skillsto turn the product owner's vision into reality.Remember, the team should be smalland we're talking about 3 to 9 people at the most.Last but not the leastamong the first three steps is the Scrum master.This person is like the coach of the team,guiding everyone through the Scrum framework and helping the teamovercome any obstacles that might slow them down.With these three key roles in place,you will be ready to start sprinting towards success.This is how a Scrum team looks like with just the three roles to deliver value.As you can see, there is no business analyst, no project manager,no leads or senior leads, etcjust the three roles,the product owner,the Scrum teamand the Scrum masterwith the three roles defined clearly,let's look into the first artifact where the team starts to work on.This is the product backlog. This is basically a to do list for your product,a high level view of everything that needs to be built or doneto make your product vision a reality.And the most important part,it's a living and breathing document that evolves over timeas your product grows and changes.Think of the product backlog as your product road map.It's the one stop shop for everything that could ever be done by your teamorganized in the order of priority.And here's another important thing,there can only be one product backlog on the project.That means the product owneris responsible for makingtough prioritization decisions across the entire spectrum of what needs to be doneall throughout the project.The product owner doesn't have to do it alone.It's important to consult with all stakeholders and the team to make surethey are representing both what the people wantand what can be built.That is why the product backlog is a starting pointfor the entire scrum framework.The fifth stepis to refine and estimate the product backlog.This is a crucial step in the processas it ensures that the team has a clear understanding ofthe effort required to complete each item on the list.The team should carefully review each itemand ask themselves some important questions.Is the item small enough to estimate?Is there enough information available to complete it?Does it create visible value?Etcadditionally, it's important to agree onthe definition of done itselfor the standards that must be met for each item to be considered doneor marked complete.When estimating the product backlog, itis best to use relative size than the number of hours spent on each item.People are simply not great at estimating hours accurately.Instead you can use a more fun and engaging approachby the use ofFibonacci sequenceand assigning a point value for each itemlike 12358, 1321 and so on.By refining and estimating the product backlog. In this way,the team can ensurethat they have a clear understanding of what needs to be doneand how much effort will be required.It's a collaborative effort that involves the entire teamand helps to set everyone up for success.The next step is sprint planning.This is where the real action beginsafter the three roles have been selected on the Scrumand the product backlog set up.The team begins the sprint planning.This is the first Scrum meeting where the team Scrum master and the product ownercome together to plan the upcoming sprintsprints are typically a fixed length of timethat is less than a month. Usually 1 to 2 weeksduring this meeting, the team looks atthe top of the product backlogand estimates how much of itthey can complete in this upcoming sprint.If the team has been working together for a few sprints,they can use their velocity,which is the number of points they completed in the last sprintto help estimate their capacityfor the upcoming sprint.The Scrum master and the team should bestriving to increase their velocity in each sprint.This is also an opportunity for the team and the product ownerto ensure that everyone understands how the product backlog itemswill contribute to the overall product visionduring this meeting,everyone should agree on a sprint goal,which is what they want to accomplish during this sprint.One important aspect of Scrum is thatonce the team commits to a set of items for the sprint,they cannot be changed or added tothe team must work autonomouslythroughout the sprint to completewhat they have forecasted, they can finish.It's important to make work visiblein a scrum,making work visible is crucial for effective team collaborationand progress tracking.And that is the seventh stepto quickly set up a Scrum framework for your projectin Scrum. One of the most popular ways to achieve this is by using a Scrum board,which is basically another conb bond board with three columns,usually with the names to do doingand done.The team creates sticky nodes for each item in the product backlogand moves them across the board as they progress through the work.It's a great way to visualize the status of each itemand make it easy for the team to knowwhat needs to be done next.Another helpful tool to make work visible is by creating a burn down chart.This chart shows the team's progress over timeby plotting the number of pointsthey have taken into the sprint on one axisand the number of days on the otherevery day.The Scrum master updates the chart by tallying upthe number of points completed by the team.The ideal outcome is a steep downward slope leading tozero points left on the last day of the sprint.And that is when you know,the team has accomplished all the scope assigned to them.This helps everyone on the team to understand how much work is left to be doneand to make adjustmentsas needed to ensurethey meet their sprint goals.The eighth stepis the daily stand up or the daily scrum.The daily scrum is the pulse of the scrumevery day.At the same time,the team gathers for a quick hurdle that lasts no longer than 15 minutes.There are three simple questions that each team member answers in this meeting.What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the sprint goal?What will you do todayto help the team finish the sprint goal?And is there anything that is blocking youor the team from achieving the sprint goal?And those are the primary three questions that are asked in this meeting.If the team takes longer than 15 minutes,then that is the indication of something is not working right?This meeting helps the entire team stay on the same pageand know where everything stands in the sprint.It also allows team members to help each otherand overcome obstacles without any micromanagementfrom above.If there are any impediments to the team's progress,it is the Scrum master's jobto remove themand that is a function of the daily standup or the daily Scrum.Next is a sprint review or sprint demo.This is time for a big show off by the team.This is where the whole gang comes togetherto see what the team has accomplished during the sprint.Anyone can come to this sprint review or demoand when we say anyone can come, we mean anyonefrom the product owner and the Scrum masterto stakeholders to management to senior leadership customersand whoever else wants to join in on the fun.It's an open showcase where the team gets to show off their stuffand what they have moved to done during the sprint.But with one big limitation,the team can only demo what has met the definition of done.That means it has to be totally and completely finished,not like partly finished or going to be finished or I think it is finished, etc,it has to be ready to be delivered without any more work.This is a time for the team to celebratesome wins and show off what they have accomplished.The last step is the sprint retrospective.All right.So the team has shown off all their amazing accomplishments during the last sprint.So now they've gathered aroundfor a little brainstorming known as sprint retrospective.This is a meeting all about looking back at what workedgreat and what maybe didn't go as smoothly as they plannedand also what can be doneto do better in the next sprint.It's all about improving their process as a team and figuring outhow to get even more awesometo make this meeting really work.Everyone's got to be on the same page and trust each other.It's not about playing the blame game.It's about figuring out how to make things better together.This is a meeting where they typically ask questions likewhy did that happen that way?And what would have made us go faster.It is super important that everyone takes responsibilityfor their part in the process and outcomesand speaks up about their concerns in a constructive way.And of course, everyone's got to be open to hearing feedback and working togetherto find solutions.By the end of the meeting,the team and Scrum master will agree on one process improvement totry out in the next sprint.They will write up acceptance tests for it,pop it back in the backlogand keep an eye on how it affects their velocity.And with that, they're ready to take on the challenges on the project.

Welcome to the lecturewhere I'm going to show you how to implement thisagile framework using our very own Motor and Pestel project.We will now be building the Motor andPestel app using the Scrom framework we just discussedand how this framework can be used to manage and deliver projects effectively.I will introduce you to the team roles of product owner,Scrum, masterthe developersand the testersand show you how they will all work together to deliver this high quality software.In very little time,we will also talk about the key ceremonies and artifacts of Scrumlike sprint planning, daily stand ups, sprint reviews and retrospectiveswhich help to keep the project on track and identify any issues early on.By the end of this lecture,you will be a Scrum master yourselfand know exactly how to apply it to your own projects.So let's dive in and get started.Let's take a few moments to revisit the Motor and Pestel App project,which is all about developing a sweet new app to help people order food with ease.The goal is to create a minimum viable productthat's functional and can get the job done.But here's the important part, the team only has three months to get it builtand a budget of $1 million to work withthe whole thing is gonna be executed within the it departmentwithin the Motor and Pestel companyusing the reliable agile approach.While there are some risks involved, like how will people interact with this app,etc,it's not a super high risk project sincesimilar products already exist in the market overall,it's gonna be a wild ride for this teamto build the app. But using the agile approach,they are up for the challenge.In order to create this app,you will build a quick Scrum team using the 10 steps we just discussed.And as shown here,I will be taking you through each of theseindividual 10 steps to create the necessary Scrum frameworkto be applied on this project.And in fact, to any other project that you may be workingin the future.
