This is the beginning of a new section on Agile topics.We begin this section on Agile by first talking aboutwhat is definable work versushigh uncertainty work.Think about how we built the pyramids earlier in this course.This is an example of definable workwhere the method to build the structurewas predeterminedand well known.You start off withinitiating the project with a defined architectural designand various structural requirementsthat are needed to build the pyramid,the type of stone and the quality of stone that will be used to build. The pyramidis also knownwhere you would source the stone fromand the raw materials to create a motorused in the structureare well known.The expertise and the resources neededto build. The structureare also well known and definedwhat is also known as how to use those resourcesto start building the structure block by block in a sequential manner.By the time the project has begun,the experts on the project are not debating aboutthe foundational architectural designor structural requirements or what stone to be used for the pyramid.Those fundamental aspectsare well defined right at the beginningand don't usually change during the course of the project.There may be a complex interdependent set of tasksin building the pyramidor for that matter, any other structure.But the precise plan for those sequence of stepsare predetermined and well plannedand are contained within the project plan.These type of projects use a traditional predictive approachthat you were introduced so farwhere the work happens in defined sequence of stepsstarting with initiating, then going to the planning phase,then executingmonitoring and controllingand finally the closing phasein here,the planning happens all up frontfor all the work to be done on the project.The scope of work is well definedin the beginning of the projectupon which the planning happensall up frontfor all the work to be done on the project. Atthis pointon the pyramids project,the pharaoh is not going to change hismind overnight from going with a pyramidal structureto let's say a cylindrical structure.It is for this scope that all the planning has taken placein terms of the resources needed,how much time they will need to build the structurewhen and where the handoffs happen from one team to another.Where does the workof one team endand the work for the other team begins.For example,where does the work for the laborers who transport the stone endand the work of stone cutters beginis pretty well laid out in the project planning.During the execution of the project, the team focusesonly on doing the work to build a structurebased on the defined plan.This type of work is called definable work.Some of the examples include projectsthat are to build homes,malls,airports, bridgesand even drug development projects.Let's now talk about what is high uncertainty work.Think about building a software application for ordering food fromyour homes using drones like our Motor and Pestel app.This type of work is high uncertainty work.As you see the team that builds a complex system like this consists ofthe various engineers, architects,people from quality developers, testers,drone engineersand various other domain expertson a project like this. Think about where does the work of a software developer end?And the work of a drone engineer beginswhere how and when should someone with domain knowledge of aerodynamics,collaborate with developers?How should designers on the teamcollaborateto design simple user interfaceand build it right into the app for a delightful user experience.The successful delivery of this type of a project is based on peoplewith multiple perspectives and expertisecollaborating in a waythat ultimately delivers a working productdelivered in the fastest possible ways into the market.The high uncertaintyon these type of projectscomes from the fact that the teamsare constantly in a state of experimentation becausethe requirements that define the scope of the projectare not fully defined. In the beginning.For example,in the beginningto create a motor and pistol app using drones, the teams will only knowthey have a requirementto allow a user to order foodfrom a nearby home, selling food.But it is not clearhow far should the app look fora home that is selling food from the person ordering food?All of that will be clarifiedwell into the project.The teams are constantly testing which features will most delight the usersor sponsors or customersand how they can improve and deliver a better performing product or service.This type of work is high uncertainty workand needs a little different type of approachto manage the project itself.This is where agile approachorin other words, the adaptive approach comes into playwhat we will discuss next will introduce youto the topic of agile in it. You will learnthe various agile concepts,the agile mindset,what constitutes an agile themeand the various life cycles within the agile project management.

Let's begin talking about agile by first knowingthe origins of agile.Much of the concepts of A Gare rooted in the concepts oflean production and manufacturing.Pioneered in the late 20th centuryby the famousToyota car company.The concept of leanis based onworking relentlessly to cut down onany waste in the production or manufacturing process.At the core of every lean systemis a relentless effort to reduce response times from the time an order is receivedfrom the customerto the final delivery of the product to the customer.As you will seevarious great concepts used in the lean systemswere then carried over to be usedin the software development and technology related projectsto obtain the same core benefitthat iscutting down timesfrom the time of the birth of a conceptto the delivery of the final working product.This need to better manage technology projectsthat are inherently riskyand of high uncertaintyhas given rise to a new approach of project management.This new approach is called the adaptive approach to project management.And the mindset behind this adaptive approachis the agile approach that we will discuss shortlyin order to better understand the concepts of lean,I now introduce to youa simple example called as the Mortar and Pestle Chocolate Factory.Let's sayour famous mortar and Pestle company also has a chocolate candy making divisioncalled the Mortar and Pestle Chocolate Factory.For the sake of simplicity,let's say they are in the business of making only one type of chocolate candy bars,their most famousroasted almond chocolate candy barsmade out of basic ingredients likemilk, cocoaand roasted almonds.Now you and I know chocolate making isa complex process and involves a lot more ingredientsthan these three simple ingredientsmentioned here. Our intention here is not to learnhow exactly to make chocolate candy,but to learn the concepts of lean production and manufacturingthrough this example.Hence, I have attemptedto teach and explain this through a simple and rather comical exampleof a fictitious chocolate factory.This will help us understandthe core concepts oflean production and manufacturingthat will then help us understandthe foundational concepts of agile used in software development projects.Let's also assume that their product,the almond roasted chocolate candy barsare so unique in taste and so much liked by the publicthat there is a huge demand for their chocolate.I'm putting this assumption out to eliminate the discussion aroundmarket economicsand the supply demand optimizations, etc.We will simply assume thatthere is a huge demand for their chocolateand all the chocolate they produce is immediately sold to the customerand that it generates immediate cash for the company.Thus,the only thing that the factory has on its mindis how fast can they make their chocolate to meet the demand?Orders are received from their customerswho are usuallybig wholesalersand they order in huge quantities from this factory,let's say100,000 units at a timeto be distributed and sent across the countryto be sold in various retail stores.With that introduction of this mortar and pestle chocolate factory.Let's get into the details ofunderstanding what happens inside this chocolate factory.

This is the chocolate production processinside the Motor and Pestel Chocolate factory.Once an order is received from a customer,let's say a large wholesale supplier,this is what happens next.Inside the chocolate factory,we now enter inside the factory to see the chocolate making operations.The process starts off simultaneouslyat two different workstations. Aworkstation is a place in the factory where individual operations are done.It could be a machine, a bench,an assembly table or simply a mixing area.As in this case,various ingredients are mixed togetheratthis workstation.It could be operated automaticallysay by a robot or by a human being.The first workstationis the workstation for churning. This is wherethe milk and cocoa are mixed to the right proportion.The second workstation is where the roasting of almonds takes place.As you can see, there are many more workstations later down the linein the chocolate making process.Once the milk and cocoa are churned togetherin the right proportion,they are sent to the next workstation,which is where further mixing happenswith the roasted almonds that are coming from the previous workstation atthis workstation the three ingredients are fully mixed in the right proportionbased on certain specificationsto producegreat tasting chocolate.This mixture is then sent to the molding workstationwhich is where the semi liquid is poured into moldsof square shapesthat you see in the end product.These are then cut into rectangular shaped chocolate candy bars.Those candy bars are then cool down to the room temperatureand finally sent to the packaging workstation.The last workstation createspiles of finished productthat are then loaded into huge trucksand shipped across the country.This is the entire process of creating roasted almond chocolate candy barsatthe Motor and Pestel Chocolate Factory.We will be using this exampleto understandmuch of the concepts of leanand how those concepts extendto the agile approach

If we were to roll up the tasks at a higher level,this is what it would look like from start to end atthe mortar and Pestle Chocolate Factory.First, the company receives an order from the customerto make chocolate candy bars.After the receipt of the order from the customer,the raw materials are ordered from the inventory within the factoryor from its outside suppliers.The next step is to begin the systematicand control process of mixing the right ingredients,pouring in the molds, cooling them,perform some tests and do quality checksand finally package the candy bars for final delivery.The final step is to deliver the product to the customer andreceive cash from the customer for the sale of the product.This set of specific actions performed by the factoryfrom the time of receiving the orderto moving through the various stages of productionand finally to deliver the finished product to the customeris called the value stream.A value stream is a sequence of activities an organization takesto deliver upon a customer's request.These individual steps form a chain of stepsin what is also called a value chain.The flow of value starts when the factory receives the order from the customerand that value flowsthrough all the steps in the middle, which is wherethe product is actually builtor produced.Finally,it ends with some form of monetary benefit that is deliveredto the company through the receipt of cash from the customer.

The total time to deliver the final product to the customer.From the time the order was received is called the lead timeor the response timecycle time is the time spent by the factory to create the product.The cycle time is always less than the lead time.Let's say the total time that the Motor and Pestel Chocolate factory takesto deliver the 100,000 chocolate barsthat were ordered by the customeris one weekfrom the time the customer placed the order.Thus the total time from order to cashis the total lead time, which is one weekall the time that the factory takes to process the raw materials, mix it together,pour them in molds and packageis a total cycle time.Let's say this is five daysfor the customer who placed the order.It is the seven days lead timethat matters the mostthe cycle time.That is how much time does a factory take to process,to process the raw materials and build the finalproduct is of no concern to the customer.All they care aboutis the total lead time,which is the timethe factory takesto deliver the final product to them afterthey have taken the order from the customerfor the people working on the factory. It is a cycle time. That is of most concern.Let me explain this through another example.When you go to a restaurant for dinnerand placed an order for food,the lead time is the time betweenafter you have placed the order with the waiterto the timewhen the waiter actually deliversthe food on your table.That is the lead timeand that is a time that matters to you as a customer,the cycle time is a timewhen the actual work begins when the chef starts to prepare your foodto the point in time when it is delivered to you on your table,which as you can see is always lesser than the lead time.

Let's now see how we can relate this world of lean production and manufacturingto the world of software development.The value stream in the technology world is very similarto the value stream. We just discussedwith some differences.This is how the value stream looks like for a typical software development project.It starts withwhen a customer or a sponsor expresses a need to have a software applicationbuilt with specific business need.At this point, it is only a concept in the minds of stakeholders or sponsorswho see a business reasonto initiate a projectthat then converts this conceptinto a monetary benefitwhich manifests in the form of a software applicationthat is then used by customersthat then generates cash for the companyin the Motor and Pistol app. Example,the company has an idea to build an app that enables peopleto order homemade food from homes around them.They figured that current food delivery appsdon't fulfill this need becausethey all deliver food only from restaurants.Based on their research. They have seen that people would want to try other options,especially healthy optionsand that has generated a business need to create an appwhich can order food from homes.Hence, they see this immense opportunity to generate cash from this idea.If they can quickly build an app that caters to this market.The value stream of a typical software project looks like thisjust like a value stream in a factory has multiple series of steps.Each step denoting a processinghappening at a particular workstationto produce an intermediate product.A tech value stream also has multiple steps in its value chain.Just like as if you're converting the raw materials to cashin a production value stream,you're converting a concept into cashin a technology value stream.However, unlike how a value stream in a factory begins with taking inthe inventory of raw materials from outside of the factory. Forfurther processing,the tech value stream begins with taking in the business idea or concept.It is from this concept and understanding of the customer's needs are obtained.This understanding is then formulated asthe customer requirementsthat function as the inventory of raw materials.These requirements will then be used tobuild the actual software product downstream.More on this topic. Later,when we discuss how these requirements are shaped in the form of user stories,the team then gets to work to build a software product,they test their codejust like in a factory workstationand finally deploy and delivera working product to the customernote. The final delivery only includes the working product,a product that the customer can start usingimmediately for whatever business need they had.Since this is a working product that the customer can start using immediately.The customer is willing to pay cash at this pointwhen this product is delivered.And hence, this is something of value to the customer.As you will see later,this working product need not be the final product asked by the customerbut can be an intermediate incrementthat finally becomesa complete working solution as the customer imagined.
