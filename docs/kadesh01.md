## Battle of Kadesh and project planning

The Battle of Kadesh occurred in ~ May 1274 BC, and involved the Hittite army led by Muwatalli II and the Egyptian army led by Ramesses II. The origin of the battle was a border dispute and failing Egyptian influence in the area (near current Syria/Lebanon border).

Both the Hittites and the Egyptians had a force of up to 50,000 individuals, with thousands of chariots involved as well.

The Hittites attacked first and made progress all the way to the camp of the Egyptians. Thinking they had won, the Hittites started plundering the camp. The Hittites retreated, but then counterattacked. The Egyptians sent more forces and pushed the Hittites back to the Orontes river.

After numerous attempted counter charges, the Hittites left the field. The Egyptians eventually marched back to Egypt without controlling the contested town of Kadesh.

Now some questions related to the battle:

So who won the battle?

That fact alone is contested. At the time, the Hittites focused on the fact that the Egyptians failed to secure Kadesh, and that they eventually withdrew back to Egypt. The Egyptians however focused on the rally that occurred after the Hittites to the camp, and the fact that their newer chariot design with its maneuverability helped push the Hittites back. Many scholars consider the battle a draw.

Did the battle follow the plans of the Hittites?

Definitely not. The attempt to plunder the Egyptian camp was a huge error that led to the eventual withdrawal from their spot, along with the loss of many lives. While they did not lose the town of Kadesh, they did not occupy the area in an uncontested way and would continue to fight the Egyptians for the area for years to come.

Did the battle follow the Egyptians plan?

Definitely not. The initial route of the forces that let the Hittites reach all the way to the Egyptian camp was a bad tactical error. And while the newer chariot design proved superior, the Egyptians still lost thousands of soldiers and chariots in the battle. The Egyptians failed to secure the area, and had to return several times over the years to push Hittite forces back. 

15 years after the initial battle, a peace treaty was signed between the Hittites and the Egyptians which solidified the borders for each.

Let's shift gears and consider software project planning...

Imagine you have a large project that you have been put in charge of. It will begin in a few months, and it will involve all of your engineering teams, numbering up to a thousand engineers across dozens of service teams.

How would you begin?

Most likely you would communicate individually with the leaders to discuss top level requirements and deadlines. You will be given the names of leaders of the engineering teams that you will want to meet next. You will start an outline of a roadmap that will fill in with details as you progress.

You will most likely have waves of engineers who will attack the project one at a time. This may be due to the needs of later teams on infrastructure created by the early teams. You will schedule ongoing syncs with the teams so you can keep track of progress and any blockers.

If you have ever been a leader or a part of a project like this? Try to recall the details if you can.

Did every step in the process proceed without a problem. Not just for your team, but for all teams involved.

If you have been part of several large projects, you will have seen failures. They may be small single team failures , failures by one team that blocked other teams from proceeding, or possibly multi team failures that caused a larger failure of the plan.

A common issue you may run into is a team telling you that their work is scheduled for a "future sprint". This is due to agile teams following the (correct) scrum process without coordination that a larger project with separate deadlines is in flight.

You may potentially share ongoing updates with leadersip ans teams that uses red, yellow or green status to give an easy summary of where components are at any point in time.

If you are lucky, you will make the larger critical deadlines. There will have been failed , less critical deadlines that were not met along the line. There may be some hard feelings that result from the agile process colliding with the larger project planning. You may have a project post mortem to go over the lessons learned. And at some point, you will start to begin a similar project.

Now to ask a critical question, that may seem like a troll but is asked in all seriousness: why did you make a project plan?
