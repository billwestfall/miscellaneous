My most critical House of Leaves fan theory

SPOILERS! will be going over critical spoilers for House of Leaves

House of Leaves is divided into 4 top level speaking narratives (with more minor narratives)

1.  The Navidson Record
2.  The Zampano manuscript
3.  Johhny Truant
4.  The Editors

But the topic of my fan theory are two short parts of the book at the end, at Johnny's narrative level

1.  Johnny's story
a.  Johnny ends up in Flagstaff as a hobo, talks to a bar band about the House of Leaves, lies on a bench
b.  Johnny wakes with a husky next to him near dawn, decides to stay in Flagstaff
c.  Things of his mother saying that "everything will be ok"

2.  Mother and baby
a.  Very detailed short story of a mother and a critically ill baby
b.  Mixed in with the realistic details is the supernatural "miracle" of the mother staying up for 3 days straight and whispering and singing to the baby
c.  The mother whispers to the baby that everything is going to be ok, and the baby passes away
d.  Significant that this story came from Johnny, but suppsedly via one of the Seattle doctors

I think the final narrative of Johnny is after he has passed away on the park bench, while sleeping. The unreal nature of the dog showing up and staying with him, and his thoughts on the words of his mother

I believe the mother and baby is the real legitimate narrative in the story, and potentially the entire rest of the book is a creation of the interaction of the mother with the baby during those 3 days
