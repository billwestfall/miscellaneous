How to approach The Silmarillion

While the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are traditional narrative stories, The Silmarillion is not. 
Many people (myself included) will give up on The Silmarillion on the first read attempt.

Let's first talk about the top level stories that form The Silmarillion:

1.  The creation of the universe and the Valar
2.  The rebellion of Melkor
3.  The arrival of the elves
4.  Feanor and the Silmarils
5.  The arrival of men
6.  Turin
7.  Gondoling
8.  Earendil and the War of Wrath
9.  Akallebeth (fall of Numenor)
10. Third Age (Ring of Power)

The Silmarillion is a mythology. It does not have a cohesive, well narrated storyline. It is many storylines that overlap at different times.
It is a lot like the Bible or other book of faith, or mythology. It is closer to a reference vs a narrative.

So the most valuable advice I can give is to approach the book like a collection of shorter stories. If you feel bogged down, you can jump to another of the stories.
You can put the book down for weeks and months, and then return to it.

When I first tried the Silmarillion, I approached it like a story. There were not a lot of writings about it at that time. I got confused quickly and put it aside.

But now, I reference a nice hardbound copy of the Silmarillion almost every day. I like to jump tp a part of the entire work that i am interested in on that particular day.

I am using the book myself as a reference to visualize how I picture the characters and events in my head, and make those visuals real. You can approach it the same way. You may want to write a fan story that goes into greater detail on a story, or write a piece of music, or make a piece of visual art.
It's ok to put the book away for quite a while and dive into other books. If you like Tolkien's world like I do, you will eventually return to it.
