## Keith Jarrett, The Koln Concert and Mindset

1. “I was due to go onstage soon, we’d had so many hassles, and the piano was such a terrible instrument. And I hadn’t slept anyway. So I was in almost hell." - Keith Jarrett

Keith Jarrett is a jazz keyboardist, and one of the foremost improvisers of twentieth -> twenty-first century jazz. Keith began his career with Art Blakey, then Charles Lloyd, then he hit the big time when he was asked to play with Miles Davis.

Around this same time, Jarrett started working with ECM label creator Manfred Eicher. Jarrett's first album for the ECM label was a solo, improvisational piano record. He followed up with more solo records, as well as records with a trio and a quartet. 

Eicher booked a solo piano tour of Europe for Jarrett for 1975. One of the scheduled dates was in Cologne (Koln), Germany on 24 January 1975.

The night before the Koln concert, Jarrett played a concert in Switzerland. The promoter of the Koln concert booked an airplane ticket for Jarrett, but he turned the ticket in for the refund in cash instead, and rode with Eicher to Koln in Eicher's Renault. Because of the cramped Renault, Jarrett got no sleep by time he got to Koln.

When he got to the concert hall, the bad luck continued. Instead of a full sized Bosendorfer grand piano, they found a baby grand that was out of tune and had broken pedals. The promoter sent Jarrett and Eicher off for dinner reservations while she worked on getting a full size piano for the concert. The concert was scheduled for 11:30 PM, so starving and exhausted and at a late hour, they headed to the restaurant.

In Jarrett's own words, they got to the restaurant and ordered promptly, but ended up waiting for an hour, the rest of the restaurant customers getting served before them. The food arrived shortly before they had to leave, but in an additional twist, the food was sub par so Jarrett ate very little.

When they got back to the concert hall, the baby grand was still on the stage. The piano tuner who had been brought in cautioned about trying to replace it last minute, since the replacement piano would be subjected to the elements and would have to be lengthily tuned before use. In addition, the microphones had already been placed around the baby grand and was ready to record. The promoter begged Jarrett to proceed, given the 1400 members of the audience already taking their seats.

So after all the incredible bad luck, the broken baby grand piano, starving and exhausted, Jarrett sat down and played.

2. "Strictly considered, writing about music is as illogical as singing about economics." - New Republic, 1918

It's impossible to convey what happened that night, that was documented in The Koln Concert album. The album was released at the end of 1975 and became the best selling solo jazz album, and the best selling jazz piano album of all time.

In lieu of describing the music myself, here are some quotes taken from Rick Beato's YouTube video "The Most Beautiful 2 Minutes of Music | Keith Jarrett", from different people about The Koln Concert:

"6 years ago I suffered a stroke...During the recovery period from my illness I listened to Jarrett's Koln Concert at least once a week. There are 3 people who saved my life: first my daughter, then the doctors and finally the music of Keith Jarrett."

"I've been listening to ‘The Köln Concert’ by Keith Jarrett since 1980, I love this music, it's timelessly beautiful."

"Keith Jarrett's Koln Concert is the sound of God"

"Keith Jarrett's Koln concert is my gold standard."

"Discovering Keith's solo recording "The Koln Concert" was life changing for me."

"One of the very first albums I obtained was Keith Jarrett Koln concert. It was there where I started my journey of improvisation and to this day this recording remains one of my most cherished and inspired acquisitions."

Ironically, Beato's video is not about The Koln Concert, but a previous live recording. The Koln Concert is such a powerful event that when people hear the name Keith Jarrett, they reflexively think of it.

3. "I believe that a truly valuable artist must be an artist who realizes the impossibility of his task - and then continues to do it." - Keith Jarrett

To tie this story back to Mindset, consider what must have been going on in Jarrett's mind the night of The Koln Concert.

Exhausted, starving, with a sub par instrument to play. He also had back pain the entired tour and had to wear back braces during concerts. But there are two additional elements to it.

A solo concert is an incredibly brave and tricky achievement to pull off. There are no band members to lean on during it. There is no trade off of solos, or times where you are just vamping along underneath. All eyes are on you with no safety net.

The other critical element of this concert is that it was entirely improvised. Not only was Jarrett in a troubled spot when the music started, not only was he alone, but he had no idea what was going to happen.

One of the critical elements of successful Mindset is bravery. You have to be brave to go against the negativity that might be present in a situation, and then guide it to safety.

Imagine a meeting you are running, where you realize two people present are at odds with each other, and it seems like they have a preexisting issue, that preceded the meeting, that is now spilling over into it.

These can be tricky and even dangerous conditions to be in as a third party. Will you listen and try to figure out who you agree with? Then take a side against the other? Will you play against both of them and confront or bring your own confrontation to the conversation? Or will you try that narrow path of landing everything and everyone safely by the end of it all?

It's incorrect that confrontation is necessarily productive for tense situations. It can be, but in the 1970's it was widely believed that confrontation was almost always the correct path when there was tension. It was good just to "get it all out". 

That is no longer the universally or even commonly held belief. Situations are much more complex than can be resolved by a simple one choise decision of confrontation.

This is not to say that backing down is the alternative. Avoiding conflict can be just as harmful as purposefully goading it.

Instead, the best choice often is to have empathy for people involved, and guide the situation to a peaceful but just conclusion.

Circling back to Jarrett's situation, imagine if he had just given up that night, as he was tempted to do? There would be no Koln Concert recording. We would have his other works, but not that special night. Look at the quotes from the Rick Beato video about The Koln Concert. Would the best thing in any universe be to not have that moment to share with people. Some people have said it literally saved their lives to connect with that music.

We'll all be in the situation Jarrett was on that night in 1975, when all the odds were against him and he had to make a decision. Think of your position, and the analogous challenges you have. Will you give up and hope to have a better situation some later time? Or will you accept the cards that fate has dealt you, accept the people and the challenges, sit down, and just start playing...
